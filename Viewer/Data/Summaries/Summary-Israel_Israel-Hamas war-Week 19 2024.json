killings, and mistreatment of detainees).\n\n(3) **Common event statistics:**\n    *   Abstract Events 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are overwhelmingly present across the majority of the relevant input texts,

Therefore, all these abstract events are selected for the summary.\n\n(4) **Summary generation:** The summary will integrate these key abstract events, prioritizing the Rafah offensive and its immediate humanitarian consequences, followed by the diplomatic efforts and broader human rights context, maintaining a chronological flow where appropriate.",
    "Summary": "The Israeli military launched a significant offensive in eastern Rafah, southern Gaza, in early May, defying widespread international warnings. This operation involved intense airstrikes and ground incursions, leading to the seizure and closure of the crucial Rafah border crossing with Egypt on May 7, and the Kerem Shalom crossing, severely disrupting humanitarian aid flow. These actions followed Israeli evacuation orders for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in eastern Rafah, forcing over a million already displaced people to flee again to areas like Al-Mawasi and Khan Younis, which lack adequate infrastructure, shelter, and basic services. Aid agencies, including UNRWA, UNICEF, and WFP, have repeatedly warned that there is \"nowhere safe\" in Gaza, and the closures have brought humanitarian operations to the brink of collapse due to critical shortages of fuel, food, water, and medicine. Reports indicate widespread hunger, with famine conditions worsening and hospitals becoming overwhelmed or non-functional, leading to preventable deaths. The offensive escalated despite Hamas announcing its acceptance of a ceasefire proposal on May 6. Israel, however, deemed the terms insufficient, though it sent a delegation for further negotiations which ultimately stalled. The United States, Israel's key ally, expressed strong concerns, pausing a bomb shipment and warning of further weapon supply halts if a full-scale Rafah invasion proceeds without credible civilian protection plans. UN officials and human rights groups have condemned the actions, highlighting the catastrophic human cost, with over 35,000 Palestinians killed, predominantly women and children, and numerous human rights violations, including unlawful killings and mistreatment of detainees. Renewed Israeli operations are also reported in northern Gaza's Jabalia camp, and violence continues to escalate in the West Bank. The international community continues to call for an immediate and lasting ceasefire to avert further tragedy."
