    "Process of thinking": "(1) **Specific event extraction:**\n    *   **Kerala Landslides (India):** Occurred early morning July 30, 2024, in Wayanad district (Mundakkai, Chooralmala, Attamala, Meppadi, Noolpuzha villages). Caused by heavy monsoon rainfall (e.g., 572mm in 48 hours vs. 204mm predicted). Death tolls varied from 24 to 358, 295, 300+, 151, 194, 201, 160, 167, 182, 123, 126, 166, 108, 93, 49, 36. Hundreds missing (e.g., 378, 200+, 187, 128). Many injured (e.g., 214, 200+, 116, 128, 186, 70, 53). Entire villages buried, hundreds of houses flattened, roads blocked/washed away, critical bridges destroyed. Thousands displaced (e.g., 8,500, 11,645, 3,000+, 5,531, 8,300) to relief camps (e.g., 85, 106, 45, 118, 82). Rescue efforts by Army, NDRF, Fire & Rescue, local teams, NGOs, using helicopters, drones, sniffer dogs, hampered by rain/terrain. PM Modi and Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan expressed condolences, pledged support, announced compensation. State of mourning declared. This is the worst disaster in Kerala since 2018 floods. Experts link it to climate change, deforestation, unplanned development in Western Ghats.\n    *   **Other India Floods/Landslides:** Delhi (July 31/Aug 1): 7-10 deaths, schools shut, traffic, flights diverted. Himachal Pradesh (July 31/Aug 1): cloudbursts, flash floods, 4-12 deaths, 33-50 missing. Uttarakhand (July 31/Aug 1): 3-4 deaths, pilgrims stranded. Bihar (Aug 1): 10-13 deaths from lightning.\n    *   **Pakistan Floods/Rains:** Lahore (Aug 1): record rainfall (360mm), 1-30 deaths, widespread floods, hospitals affected, schools/offices closed. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: 12-24 deaths.

    "Summary": "Massive landslides, triggered by unprecedented monsoon rainfall, devastated Kerala's Wayanad district in southern India starting early on July 30, 2024. Villages like Mundakkai, Chooralmala, and Attamala were severely impacted, with some areas receiving 572mm of rain in 48 hours, far exceeding predictions. This catastrophe has resulted in a significant human toll, with death counts consistently reported in the hundreds (ranging from 270 to over 300), hundreds more missing (e.g., 378, 200+), and many injured (e.g., 214, 220). Most victims were tea estate workers caught unaware as they slept. The disaster caused widespread destruction, flattening hundreds of houses, blocking and washing away roads, and destroying critical bridges, particularly the main link to Chooralmala. Thousands of people (over 8,500 to 11,645) have been displaced and moved to numerous relief camps. Rescue and relief operations, involving the Indian Army, NDRF, Fire & Rescue, civil defense, and local NGOs, have been extensive but severely hampered by ongoing heavy rains, unstable terrain, and huge boulders. Helicopters, drones, and sniffer dogs are being utilized, and temporary bridges are being constructed to improve access. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan expressed condolences, pledged full support, and announced compensation for victims' families, with the state declaring a period of mourning. Relief camps are providing essential food, water, and medical aid. This event is part of a broader pattern of severe monsoon-related disasters across South Asia. Concurrent heavy rains and floods have also affected other parts of India, including Delhi (causing 7-10 deaths, school closures, traffic snarls), Himachal Pradesh (cloudbursts, flash floods, 4-12 deaths, 33-50 missing), Uttarakhand (cloudbursts, 3-4 deaths), and Bihar (lightning strikes, 10-13 deaths). Pakistan also experienced record-breaking rainfall in Lahore, leading to floods and fatalities, with warnings issued for Sindh and Balochistan. Experts attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of these erratic monsoon events to climate change, exacerbated by deforestation and unplanned development in ecologically sensitive regions like the Western Ghats."
