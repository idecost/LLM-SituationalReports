    "Summary": "Severe flooding has devastated Maiduguri, Borno State, and other regions of Nigeria in early September 2024, marking the worst such disaster in Maiduguri in three decades. Primarily triggered by heavy rainfall and the overflow of the Alau Dam (or the Ngadda River into its dyke, as clarified by the Federal Government), the crisis is intensified by climate change and pre-existing inadequate infrastructure. Nationwide, over one million people have been affected, with Borno State bearing the brunt. Confirmed deaths in Borno range from 30 to 37, contributing to a national death toll exceeding 250. Hundreds of thousands, potentially up to two million, have been displaced across multiple states including Niger, Jigawa, Yobe, Adamawa, Kaduna, Kano, Bauchi, and Abuja. The floods have caused extensive destruction, submerging thousands of homes and damaging vital infrastructure such as bridges, roads, hospitals, schools, markets, power, and communication networks. Vast farmlands have been destroyed, severely worsening food insecurity for millions, with 32 million Nigerians already facing acute hunger. Dangerous animals escaped from the Maiduguri zoo, and prison walls collapsed, leading to inmate escapes. The humanitarian situation is critical, with heightened risks of waterborne diseases like cholera due to poor sanitation and contaminated water sources. Government agencies, UN bodies, and NGOs are actively providing emergency relief, including food, shelter, water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH) services, and medical aid, alongside ongoing search and rescue operations and needs assessments. The UN has allocated $6 million from the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund to Borno, appealing for further international support to address significant funding gaps. Discussions are also underway for long-term solutions focusing on climate resilience and infrastructure improvements."
