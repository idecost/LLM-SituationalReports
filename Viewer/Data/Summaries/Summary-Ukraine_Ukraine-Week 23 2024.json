    "Summary": "The ongoing conflict in Ukraine continues to exact a devastating humanitarian toll, with intensified attacks leading to a significant rise in civilian casualties, particularly in the Kharkiv region. May 2024 recorded the highest monthly civilian casualties in nearly a year, largely due to a new Russian ground offensive. Critical civilian infrastructure, including homes, schools, health facilities, and energy systems, faces widespread destruction and disruption. Over 600 Ukrainian children have been killed and 1,420 injured since February 2022, with many enduring months in bomb shelters, while Russia continues to deny access to occupied territories for verification.\\n\\nThis violence has triggered massive displacement, with millions fleeing Ukraine and over 3.39 million internally displaced. Neighboring countries like Romania, Moldova, and Slovakia host millions of Ukrainian refugees, grappling with challenges in providing long-term accommodation, education, employment, and specialized healthcare, especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and persons with disabilities.\\n\\nIn response, a comprehensive humanitarian effort involving UN agencies, NGOs, and Red Cross societies is delivering multi-sectoral assistance, including food, water, shelter, health services, cash and voucher assistance (CVA), and psychosocial support. Robust coordination mechanisms, such as the Protection Cluster and Emergency Telecommunications Cluster, are active. However, significant funding gaps persist, with the 2024 humanitarian appeal only partially met, and access to approximately 1.5 million civilians in Russian-occupied areas remains severely limited.\\n\\nOne year after the Kakhovka Dam's destruction in June 2023, its devastating impacts endure, including widespread flooding, depleted water supplies for over 700,000 people, and the displacement of unexploded ordnance (UXO), necessitating ongoing recovery efforts.\\n\\nLooking ahead, reconstruction and recovery planning are critical, with estimated costs exceeding $486 billion over ten years. The upcoming Ukraine Recovery Conference in Berlin (June 11-12) is a key platform to secure financing and promote sustainable, climate-resilient, and inclusive rebuilding. Calls emphasize prioritizing children's rights, including rebuilding damaged schools and ending the legacy of institutionalizing children, and ensuring meaningful participation of women and gender equality in all recovery processes.\\n\\nConcerns also remain high regarding nuclear safety, particularly at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), and the broader energy infrastructure, which has been severely impacted by attacks, leading to widespread power disruptions. Additionally, efforts are underway to locate tens of thousands of missing persons through DNA identification, and to address the pervasive risk of explosive ordnance, as studies show many teenagers engage in risky behavior despite awareness."
