It was forecast to move northwards and make landfall between Sagar Island (India) and Khepupara (Bangladesh), near Mongla, by midnight on May 26.\\n- **Abstract Event 2 (Landfall and Immediate Intensity):** The Severe Cyclonic Storm Remal made landfall on the night of May 26, crossing the Bangladesh coast in the Khepupara district with maximum sustained wind speeds of 110-120 kmph, gusting to 135 kmph.\\n- **Abstract Event 3 (Widespread Impacts and Risks):** Remal brought heavy rainfall and storm surges, initially forecast at 1-4 meters (up to 12 feet in some areas) above astronomical tide, causing widespread inundation and significant damage to homes, infrastructure, and crops in coastal West Bengal and Bangladesh. Approximately 8.4 million people, including vulnerable Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, were at risk, leading to initial casualties such as a ferry sinking and a drowning.\\n- **Abstract Event 4 (Extensive Preparedness and Humanitarian Response):** In anticipation, authorities in both Bangladesh and India raised the highest danger signals, evacuating hundreds of thousands of people (over 800,000 in Bangladesh, 50,000+ in India) to thousands of designated shelters. Ports and major airports were closed. Humanitarian organizations like the World Food Programme (WFP) provided anticipatory cash assistance to 30,000 families, while UNICEF prepositioned supplies and mobilized staff. Governments, UN agencies, and NGOs coordinated extensive early warning dissemination and response efforts.\\n- **Abstract Event 5 (Underlying Climate Vulnerability and Humanitarian Challenges):** The region's susceptibility to such intense storms is exacerbated by climate change, which has increased the frequency of superstorms, erratic rainfall, and heatwaves, leading to health crises like chronic kidney disease from salinization. This vulnerability is compounded by ongoing humanitarian funding shortfalls, which have already reduced aid for populations, including nearly a million Rohingya refugees in densely populated camps, who face heightened risks from both natural disasters and pre-existing socio-economic hardships. Despite Bangladesh's improved disaster resilience through better forecasting and evacuations, poverty remains a critical factor in vulnerability.\\n\\n(3) Common event statistics:\\n- Abstract Event 1 (Cyclone Remal's Genesis and Trajectory): Covered by 15 texts (1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 22, 23, 28, 31, 36, 40, 42, 44, 49).\\n- Abstract Event 2 (Landfall and Immediate Intensity): Covered by 18 texts (1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 20, 22, 23, 28, 31, 36, 40, 42, 44, 49).\\n- Abstract Event 3 (Widespread Impacts and Risks): Covered by 14 texts (7, 10, 11, 12, 18, 20, 22, 23, 28, 31, 36, 40, 44, 49).\\n- Abstract Event 4 (Extensive Preparedness and Humanitarian Response): Covered by 12 texts (10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 31, 36, 49).\\n- Abstract Event 5 (Underlying Climate Vulnerability and Humanitarian Challenges): Covered by 23 texts (2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 34, 35, 37, 38, 43, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51).\\n\\nAll five abstract events are highly common and represent the core information.

It was forecast to move northwards and make landfall between Sagar Island (India) and Khepupara (Bangladesh), near Mongla, by midnight on May 26.\\n- **Abstract Event 2 (Landfall and Immediate Intensity):** The Severe Cyclonic Storm Remal made landfall on the night of May 26, crossing the Bangladesh coast in the Khepupara district with maximum sustained wind speeds of 110-120 kmph, gusting to 135 kmph.\\n- **Abstract Event 3 (Widespread Impacts and Risks):** Remal brought heavy rainfall and storm surges, initially forecast at 1-4 meters (up to 12 feet in some areas) above astronomical tide, causing widespread inundation and significant damage to homes, infrastructure, and crops in coastal West Bengal and Bangladesh. Approximately 8.4 million people, including vulnerable Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, were at risk, leading to initial casualties such as a ferry sinking and a drowning.\\n- **Abstract Event 4 (Extensive Preparedness and Humanitarian Response):** In anticipation, authorities in both Bangladesh and India raised the highest danger signals, evacuating hundreds of thousands of people (over 800,000 in Bangladesh, 50,000+ in India) to thousands of designated shelters. Ports and major airports were closed. Humanitarian organizations like the World Food Programme (WFP) provided anticipatory cash assistance to 30,000 families, while UNICEF prepositioned supplies and mobilized staff. Governments, UN agencies, and NGOs coordinated extensive early warning dissemination and response efforts.\\n- **Abstract Event 5 (Underlying Climate Vulnerability and Humanitarian Challenges):** The region's susceptibility to such intense storms is exacerbated by climate change, which has increased the frequency of superstorms, erratic rainfall, and heatwaves, leading to health crises like chronic kidney disease from salinization. This vulnerability is compounded by ongoing humanitarian funding shortfalls, which have already reduced aid for populations, including nearly a million Rohingya refugees in densely populated camps, who face heightened risks from both natural disasters and pre-existing socio-economic hardships. Despite Bangladesh's improved disaster resilience through better forecasting and evacuations, poverty remains a critical factor in vulnerability.\\n\\n(3) Common event statistics:\\n- Abstract Event 1 (Cyclone Remal's Genesis and Trajectory): Covered by 15 texts (1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 22, 23, 28, 31, 36, 40, 42, 44, 49).\\n- Abstract Event 2 (Landfall and Immediate Intensity): Covered by 18 texts (1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 20, 22, 23, 28, 31, 36, 40, 42, 44, 49).\\n- Abstract Event 3 (Widespread Impacts and Risks): Covered by 14 texts (7, 10, 11, 12, 18, 20, 22, 23, 28, 31, 36, 40, 44, 49).\\n- Abstract Event 4 (Extensive Preparedness and Humanitarian Response): Covered by 12 texts (10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 31, 36, 49).\\n- Abstract Event 5 (Underlying Climate Vulnerability and Humanitarian Challenges): Covered by 23 texts (2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 34, 35, 37, 38, 43, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51).\\n\\nAll five abstract events are highly common and represent the core information.
