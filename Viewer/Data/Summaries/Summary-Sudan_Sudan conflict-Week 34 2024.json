    "Summary": "The 16-month conflict in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) continues to inflict a severe humanitarian catastrophe. Intense fighting, including army airstrikes on civilian areas and hospitals, coupled with RSF attacks involving looting, abductions, and sexual violence, has led to widespread devastation. A senior RSF commander was recently killed in West Kordofan, highlighting the ongoing clashes. Over 10 million people are internally displaced, and more than 2 million have fled to neighboring countries, straining regional resources. Famine has been confirmed in North Darfur's Zamzam camp and threatens 13-14 other regions, leaving over 25 million people acutely hungry, with children disproportionately affected by malnutrition and lack of education. Host communities are providing crucial support amid this crisis. A cholera epidemic has been declared, with hundreds of cases and dozens of deaths, exacerbated by seasonal floods and contaminated water. Other diseases like dengue and malaria are also rising, while over 70% of healthcare facilities remain non-functional due to the conflict. Humanitarian aid delivery is severely hampered by active fighting, bureaucratic impediments, looting by warring parties, and impassable roads due to heavy rains and widespread flooding. The critical Adre border crossing with Chad was reopened for three months after a six-month closure, allowing initial WFP and IOM convoys to deliver food for thousands, but further movements face procedural hurdles. Aid workers operate in extreme danger, with Sudan being one of the deadliest places; at least 22 have been killed this year. The humanitarian response remains significantly underfunded. The war has devastated Sudan's economy, destroying major sectors and causing an 18.3% economic contraction in 2023, currency devaluation, and soaring prices. Diplomatic efforts, including US-led talks and the Jeddah platform, continue but face challenges, with the Sudanese army often refusing to participate or adhere to agreements."
