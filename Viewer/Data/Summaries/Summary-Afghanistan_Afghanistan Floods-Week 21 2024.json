    "Process of thinking": "(1) **Specific event extraction:**\\n*   **Floods:** Heavy rainfall caused violent flash floods in northern, northeastern, and western Afghanistan (Text 2, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 21, 25, 26, 30, 33, 38, 42, 43, 44, 47, 49, 50, 53, 55, 56, 61, 62, 63, 64, 67). These events followed a dry winter and were compounded by early snowmelt (Text 38, 49). Afghanistan is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing erratic weather patterns and droughts (Text 33, 35, 38, 44, 47, 49, 53, 57, 67).\\n*   **Impact of Floods:** Hundreds of people killed (180, 120, 300, 110, 66, 50, 55, 347, 48, 40, 62, >400, 215, >200, 540) and thousands injured (Text 2, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 21, 25, 26, 30, 33, 37, 38, 42, 43, 44, 47, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 55, 56, 61, 62, 63, 64, 67). Thousands of homes destroyed/damaged (3,000, 9,700, 1,143, 1,805, 7,800, 1,890, 2,000, 400, 8,700, 1,500, 6,000, 259, 3,100) (Text 2, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 21, 25, 26, 30, 32, 33, 42, 43, 44, 47, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 55, 56, 61, 62, 63, 64, 67). Extensive damage to critical public infrastructure (roads, bridges, health facilities, schools) (Text 2, 10, 11, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 30, 33, 35, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 61, 63, 64, 67). Significant agricultural land and livestock lost (Text 11, 14, 17, 30, 33, 38, 39, 43, 44, 47, 49, 50, 53, 61, 64, 67), impacting 80% of the population dependent on farming (Text 47, 49, 53, 67). Increased waterborne illnesses (diarrhea, skin infections, cholera, ARI pneumonia, measles) reported (Text 6, 21, 25, 42, 46, 49, 51, 52, 54, 56, 64, 67).\\n*   **Humanitarian Needs:** Urgent need for emergency shelter, food, water, medical supplies, hygiene kits, cash (Text 6, 8, 12, 13, 15, 21, 26, 30, 33, 35, 37, 38, 42, 43, 44, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 55, 56, 61, 62, 63, 64, 67). Afghanistan faces severe food insecurity (15.8 million acutely food-insecure, 23.7 million require assistance in 2024, 4 million acutely malnourished) (Text 9, 20, 35, 44, 49, 65). Women and girls are disproportionately affected, facing heightened protection risks, lack of sanitation/hygiene products, and increased child marriages (Text 18, 31, 35, 36, 46, 48, 49, 56, 60).\\n*   **Humanitarian Response:** Numerous organizations (WFP, WHO, UNICEF, IOM, UNHCR, Red Cross, IMC, FSAC) are providing multi-sectoral aid (food, NFI, medical, WASH, cash, MHPSS, shelter) (Text 4, 8, 13, 15, 21, 22, 26, 30, 35, 37, 38, 41, 42, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 55, 56, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67). WFP urgently needs USD 14.5 million for flood response (Text 8, 26, 38, 49, 55).\\n*   **Challenges to Response:** Damaged infrastructure and challenging terrain render many affected areas inaccessible, hampering aid delivery (Text 14, 15, 17, 21, 25, 26, 37, 42, 43, 46, 47, 50, 51, 52, 53, 61, 64, 67). Funding shortfalls and cultural barriers impacting women and girls also pose significant challenges (Text 12, 26, 35, 38, 44, 46, 49, 53, 56, 64, 67).\\n*   **Returnees:** Pakistan's \"Illegal Foreigners’ Repatriation Plan\" (announced Sep 2023) led to a surge in Afghan returnees, with over 595,000 returning since Sep 2023 (Text 3, 7, 19, 24, 29, 31, 35, 36, 60, 66). Returnees face food insecurity, lack of financial aid, housing, and heightened protection risks (Text 19, 31, 36, 60). UNHCR and IOM are monitoring and assisting at border crossings (Text 3, 7, 24, 29, 36, 41, 60, 66).\\n*   **Long-term Needs:** Critical need for long-term resilience-building initiatives, improved early warning systems, and climate adaptation projects (Text 33, 38, 44, 49, 57, 63, 67).\\n\\n(2) **Event abstraction and generalization:**\\n*   **Abstract Event 1 (Floods & Climate Vulnerability):** Severe flash floods caused by heavy rainfall have devastated multiple regions of Afghanistan, particularly the northeastern and western provinces, since early May 2024, underscoring the country's extreme vulnerability to climate change and erratic weather patterns.

    "Summary": "Afghanistan is grappling with severe flash floods caused by heavy rainfall since early May 2024, devastating multiple regions, particularly the northeastern and western provinces. These events underscore the country's extreme vulnerability to climate change and erratic weather patterns. The floods have resulted in hundreds of fatalities and injuries, with casualty figures expected to rise, and thousands of homes destroyed or damaged, displacing countless families. Critical public infrastructure, including roads, bridges, health facilities, and schools, has sustained extensive damage, while significant agricultural land and livestock losses severely impact the 80% of the population dependent on farming. A surge in waterborne diseases and other illnesses is reported, exacerbated by poor sanitation and lack of clean water.\\n\\nThis disaster has intensified an already dire humanitarian crisis, straining limited resources and jeopardizing recent food security gains. Afghanistan faces severe food insecurity, with 15.8 million people acutely food-insecure and 23.7 million requiring assistance in 2024. Women and girls are disproportionately affected, facing heightened protection risks, lack of access to sanitation, and increased child marriages.\\n\\nNumerous humanitarian organizations, including WFP, WHO, UNICEF, IOM, and Red Cross partners, are actively providing multi-sectoral aid. However, aid delivery is severely hampered by damaged infrastructure, inaccessible areas, and critical funding shortfalls, with WFP alone needing USD 14.5 million for its flood response.\\n\\nCompounding these challenges, Pakistan's \\\"Illegal Foreigners’ Repatriation Plan\\\" has led to over 595,000 Afghan returnees since September 2023, who face additional burdens of food insecurity, lack of housing, and protection risks. There is an urgent call for long-term resilience-building, improved early warning systems, and climate adaptation projects to prepare Afghanistan for future disasters."
