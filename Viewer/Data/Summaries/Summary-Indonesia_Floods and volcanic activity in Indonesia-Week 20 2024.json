    "Summary": "On May 11, heavy rains triggered deadly flash floods and cold lava (lahar) flows from Mount Marapi in West Sumatra, Indonesia. This disaster resulted in a significant number of fatalities, rising to at least 67 people, with up to 35 others reported missing. The cold lava, a mixture of volcanic material and pebbles, caused extensive damage, submerging hundreds of houses and buildings, destroying roads, bridges, and agricultural land across districts like Agam and Tanah Datar. The catastrophe prompted extensive search and rescue operations involving police, military, and local teams, along with large-scale evacuations of over 4,000 people to temporary shelters. The government declared a 14-day emergency response period, with President Joko Widodo overseeing relief efforts, including aid distribution and plans to relocate survivors to safer areas and build new houses within six months. Weather modification technology (cloud seeding) was also deployed to mitigate further heavy rainfall. Mount Marapi is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, known for sudden, unpredictable eruptions, including a deadly one in December 2023. Experts emphasized the urgent need for improved disaster mitigation, end-to-end early warning systems, community drills, and nature conservation, acknowledging that previous \"galodo\" events had not led to sufficient preparedness. Concurrently, Indonesia faced other significant volcanic activity. Ibu volcano in North Maluku experienced multiple eruptions throughout May, spewing ash up to 6km high and prompting the highest alert level and evacuations of seven nearby villages. North Sulawesi's Ruang volcano also erupted recently, leading to the evacuation of over 12,000 people. These events underscore Indonesia's high susceptibility to natural disasters, situated on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\" with 127 active volcanoes."
