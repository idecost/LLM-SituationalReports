    "summary": "Bangladesh is currently facing the severe threat of Cyclone Remal, which was expected to make landfall by midnight on May 26th, 2024, near Sagar Island, India and Khepupara, Bangladesh, with maximum wind speeds of 110-120 km/hr and gusts up to 135 km/hr[11][72]. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department has issued Great Danger Signal No. 10 for coastal districts like Mongla, Payra, Khulna, Satkhira, Barguna, Patuakhali, and Bhola, warning of potential floods, flash floods, landslides, and a storm surge up to 12 feet[60][59]. This storm threatens an exposed population of 11 million people[72], including 1.3 million vulnerable individuals[20], and exacerbates existing challenges for coastal communities, many of whom are still recovering from recent heatwaves and fires[6]. The situation is further complicated by a recent fire in B3 Camp-13, which displaced 4,000 people who now require shelter, food, and water as the cyclone approaches[7]. In response, nearly a million people are fleeing inland to concrete storm shelters[62], with 4,000 cyclone shelters prepared for evacuation[73], and organizations like the World Food Programme (WFP) have dispatched anticipatory cash assistance to over 30,000 at-risk families (150,000 people) in Khulna and Barishal Divisions to aid in preparation and recovery[37]. World Vision Bangladesh is also mobilizing to assist fire survivors and prepare for the storm's impact, prioritizing the safety and well-being of affected children and communities[7].",

            "cluster_summary": "Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar endure inhumane living conditions, with no investment in their living conditions or education, leading to a dire situation as conditions in the camps continue to deteriorate[1][2]. These refugees are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events such as cyclones and landslides, and climate-induced hazards like floods and cyclones pose additional threats, resulting in internal displacement[1][3]. The camps have also experienced fires, including incidents where LPG gas canisters exploded, causing significant damage[4][2]. Health challenges are rampant, with outbreaks of diseases such as diphtheria, cholera, measles, COVID-19, scabies, and dengue, exacerbated by waste around the camps[4][5].\n\nIn response to Cyclone Remal, World Vision Bangladesh (WVB) has scaled up its efforts to support vulnerable children and communities. The organization is on high alert, prioritizing safety and providing critical support for coastal communities, children, and families[6]. Local mobilization is key to their cyclone preparedness and anticipatory action, with the World Vision BRCR team mobilizing a rapid response to aid fire survivors and prepare for the storm's impact[6][7][8]. Essential relief materials, including dry food supplies, have been prepositioned throughout the region, and trained staff with logistical equipment are ready for rapid deployment[9]. Emergency Operation Centers have been activated to facilitate a swift response, and coordination with other NGOs, UN agencies, and government bodies ensures a comprehensive approach that prioritizes the needs of affected children and communities[9][10][8]. Additionally, World Vision's Child Protection Team has provided foster care services and reunified missing children with their families[11].\n\nThe Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG), a platform for government and non-government humanitarian agencies under the Humanitarian Coordination Task Team (HCTT), has conducted an impact analysis of Cyclone Remal[12][13][14]. NAWG compiles and interpolates information from sources like the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) for its reports, which are intended for internal use by NAWG Bangladesh Members for preparatory activities[15][16]. Their analysis indicates that up to 1.9 million people are at risk, with an exposed population of 11 million in areas experiencing wind speeds of 110-120 km/h[12][13].\n\nUNICEF has established three contingency partnerships with civil society organizations (CSOs) ready for activation in cyclone-affected areas, with an additional 19 partnerships available for reprogramming in emergencies[17][18]. The World Food Programme (WFP) has provided 3,400 Rohingya refugees with fortified biscuits as part of their response to Cyclone Remal, and ongoing needs assessments are being conducted to evaluate the potential damage[19][20].\n\nThe global humanitarian funding crisis, characterized by a significant shortfall, has hindered the ability of organizations to meet their targets, assisting less than two-thirds of the people they aimed to support in 2023[21][22]. This crisis is exacerbated by conflicts, climate emergencies, and collapsing economies, leading to catastrophic hunger, massive displacement, and disease outbreaks[23]. The need for more flexible funding mechanisms, such as multi-year funding and reduced restrictions on fund allocation, is crucial to enhance the effectiveness of support[24].\n\nTo reduce the vulnerability of low-income households to cyclones and other climate-related disasters, several measures can be implemented. These include poverty reduction, infrastructure and housing improvements, access to basic resources, early warning systems, agricultural productivity, financial resilience, strong governance and support, and human capital development[25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32].",

Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar are vulnerable to extreme weather events, with urgent climate mitigation and disaster preparedness measures needed to mitigate risks such as cyclones and landslides. Displaced populations like the Rohingya are particularly susceptible to secondary displacement due to settling in hazard-prone areas, exacerbating the risk of climate-related movement on a larger scale. The combination of food insecurity, violence, lack of livelihoods, and dwindling hope for durable solutions has led to a surge in irregular maritime movement of Rohingya across the region in recent months.Though conflict remains the primary driver of Rohingya displacement, climate and environmental factors along with the deteriorating conditions in the camps significantly exacerbates migration risks, particularly during perilous sea journeys.",

            "cluster_summary": "Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar endure inhumane living conditions, with no investment in their living conditions or education, leading to a dire situation as conditions in the camps continue to deteriorate[1][2]. These refugees are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events like cyclones and landslides, and climate-induced hazards such as floods and cyclones pose additional threats, leading to internal displacement[1][3]. Fires have also occurred in the camps, including an incident where an LPG gas canister exploded in a hut, setting it on fire[4][2]. Health challenges are rampant, with outbreaks of diseases such as diphtheria, cholera, measles, COVID-19, scabies, and dengue[4]. Skin diseases like dengue, eczema, and scabies are spreading rapidly due to waste around the camps[5].\n\nIn Khulna, residents, particularly around the Notun Bazar area, regularly use saline water for cooking, drinking, and bathing[40]. The increasing salinisation of freshwater resources in the region is putting the health of local populations under greater threat, becoming a major health hazard with deadly consequences[41][42]. Research has investigated the effects of water salinity on kidney health, finding that drinking-water sodium and urinary sodium are associated with increased protein excretion, a powerful marker for kidney disease[43][44]. Among 1,185 trial participants, 37 had mild proteinuria and 20 had moderate or substantial proteinuria[43]. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been diagnosed in Khulna, with one individual's kidneys not working properly for nearly seven years, severely affecting her heart, lungs, and central nervous system[42][45]. An increase in kidney-related diseases is expected if water quality does not improve[46][47].\n\nExtreme heat in Khulna has led to a rise in hospital admissions, with patients occupying corridors and stairways as wards ran out of beds[41]. High temperatures cause profound sweating, loss of body fluid, and dehydration, affecting both men and women in tropical regions[41][42]. The water crisis, including a lack of suitable drinking water for rehydration, exacerbates these health issues[41][40].\n\nIn response to Cyclone Remal, several measures have been implemented in Khulna, Bangladesh, to address public health challenges and the healthcare system's capacity. Emergency medical teams have been formed, with 359 teams specifically established in the coastal districts of Bagerhat, Khulna, and Satkhira[48][49]. Civil Surgeons have been instructed to ensure adequate medicines and logistics are prepositioned in hospitals, including water purification tablets (WPT), IV saline, oral rehydration solution (ORS), and first aid kits with anti-snake venoms[49]. Additionally, 706 Government Primary Schools (GPSs) have been identified and converted into cyclone shelters to accommodate families at risk[49].\n\nWorld Vision Bangladesh (WVB) is actively supporting vulnerable children and communities affected by Cyclone Remal by scaling up response efforts and prioritizing safety and critical support for coastal communities[6]. WVB has prepositioned essential relief materials, including dry food supplies, and trained staff and logistical equipment are strategically positioned for rapid deployment[9]. The organization is coordinating with other NGOs, UN agencies, and government bodies to ensure a comprehensive response that prioritizes the needs of affected children and communities[10][8].\n\nThe Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) has conducted an impact analysis of Cyclone Remal, projecting that up to 1.9 million people are at risk, with an exposed population of 11 million in areas with high wind speeds[12]. NAWG functions as a platform for government and non-government humanitarian agencies under the Humanitarian Coordination Task Team (HCTT), compiling information from sources like the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) for its reports[13][14][16].\n\nCurrent gaps in early warning systems have significant implications for cyclone preparedness in regions like Bangladesh, where accurate forecasts and useful early warnings are hindered by unavailable weather data from exclusive economic zones[32]. These gaps prevent timely evacuations, increasing vulnerability in lower-income countries[29][50]. To address the impact of Cyclone Remal, the World Food Programme (WFP) provided 3,400 Rohingya refugees with fortified biscuits, and ongoing needs assessments are being conducted to determine the extent of potential damage[19][20].",

Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar are vulnerable to extreme weather events, with urgent climate mitigation and disaster preparedness measures needed to mitigate risks such as cyclones and landslides. Displaced populations like the Rohingya are particularly susceptible to secondary displacement due to settling in hazard-prone areas, exacerbating the risk of climate-related movement on a larger scale. The combination of food insecurity, violence, lack of livelihoods, and dwindling hope for durable solutions has led to a surge in irregular maritime movement of Rohingya across the region in recent months.Though conflict remains the primary driver of Rohingya displacement, climate and environmental factors along with the deteriorating conditions in the camps significantly exacerbates migration risks, particularly during perilous sea journeys.",

            "cluster_summary": "Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar endure inhumane living conditions, with no investment in their living conditions or education, leading to a dire situation as conditions in the camps continue to deteriorate[1][2]. These refugees are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events like cyclones and landslides, and climate-induced hazards such as floods and cyclones pose additional threats, leading to internal displacement[1][3]. Fires have also occurred in the camps, including an incident where an LPG gas canister exploded in a hut, setting it on fire[4][2]. Health challenges are rampant, with outbreaks of diseases such as diphtheria, cholera, measles, COVID-19, scabies, and dengue[4]. Skin diseases like dengue, eczema, and scabies are spreading rapidly due to waste around the camps[5].\n\nIn Khulna, the water crisis is severe, with a stalled water treatment plant that was once a \"beacon of hope\" now abandoned due to high costs and internal politics, contributing to a shortage of clean and safe water[51][40][52]. Residents, particularly in areas like Notun Bazar, regularly use saline water for cooking, drinking, and bathing, which has become a major health hazard with deadly consequences[40][41]. The increasing salinisation of freshwater resources is putting the health of local populations under greater threat[42]. Research has shown that drinking-water sodium and urinary sodium are associated with increased protein excretion, a powerful marker for kidney disease, with elevated levels of protein in urine observed in trial participants[43][44]. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been diagnosed in Khulna, with individuals experiencing severe health impacts, including one case where the kidneys had not been functioning properly for nearly seven years, affecting the heart, lungs, and central nervous system[42][52][45]. An increase in kidney-related diseases is expected if water quality does not improve[46][47].\n\nThe population in Khulna also faces health implications from extreme heat, which has led to a rise in hospital admissions, with patients occupying corridors and stairways as wards ran out of beds[41]. High temperatures cause profound sweating, loss of body fluid, and dehydration, with research linking ambient temperature data to participants' health outcomes, showing that women in tropical regions are as susceptible to the effects of high ambient temperature exposure as men[41][42][44].\n\nIn response to public health challenges posed by Cyclone Remal, particularly concerning the healthcare system's capacity, several measures have been implemented in Khulna, Bangladesh. Emergency medical teams have been formed and are ready to respond in all districts, with 359 medical teams specifically established in the coastal districts of Bagerhat, Khulna, and Satkhira[48][49]. Civil Surgeons have been instructed to ensure adequate medicines and logistics are prepositioned in hospitals, including water purification tablets (WPT), IV saline, oral rehydration solution (ORS), and first aid kits with anti-snake venoms[49]. Additionally, 706 Government Primary Schools have been identified and converted into cyclone shelters to accommodate families at risk[49].\n\nThe Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) has conducted an impact analysis of Cyclone Remal, projecting that up to 1.9 million people are at risk, with an exposed population of 11 million people in areas with wind speeds of 110-120 km/hr[12][13]. The World Food Programme (WFP) has provided 3,400 Rohingya refugees with fortified biscuits as part of the response to the cyclone's impact on the nearly 1 million Rohingya people in the world's largest refugee camp[19][20]. Ongoing needs assessments are being conducted to update and determine the extent of potential damage caused by the cyclone[19].\n\nPreventive measures taken by households have increased, and latrine conditions have improved, demonstrating a lasting shift in community practices and infrastructure[53]. To ensure long-term sustainability, ongoing engagement, resource mobilization, and the integration of feedback mechanisms are required to adapt and respond to emerging needs and challenges[53].",

Accurate forecasts and effective early warnings for cyclones require comprehensive data collection from all countries within a region, which is then integrated into weather models[32]. However, a notable data gap exists because weather data from exclusive economic zones is currently unavailable[32]. This lack of data is compounded by the difficulty in predicting cyclones that form from the lower to middle troposphere, as these are not well organized and the winds in the middle troposphere are not as strong[32].\n\nThese deficiencies in early warning systems mean that people cannot evacuate before a hazard strikes, preventing a temporary reduction in their exposure to the danger[29][27]. Expanding the coverage of early warning systems would help mitigate this exposure[29]. The absence of such systems contributes to increased vulnerability in lower-income countries[50], where people are less protected[29] and populations cannot adequately prepare for storms[31].",

These refugees are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events such as cyclones and landslides, and climate-induced hazards like floods and cyclones further threaten their safety, often resulting in internal displacement[1][3]. The camps have also experienced fires, including incidents where LPG gas canisters exploded, setting huts ablaze[4][2].\n\nHealth challenges are rampant, with numerous outbreaks of diseases such as diphtheria, cholera, measles, COVID-19, scabies, and dengue[4]. Skin diseases like dengue, eczema, and scabies are spreading rapidly due to waste accumulation around the camps[5]. This health crisis is compounded by a global humanitarian funding shortfall, which has created a \"crisis within a crisis\"[21][22]. In 2023, humanitarian organizations were unable to meet their targets, assisting less than two-thirds of the people they aimed to support[21]. Plans for 2024 are ultra-prioritized with extremely tightened budgets[21].\n\nThe challenges faced include a widening gap between needs and response, exacerbated by conflicts, climate emergencies, and collapsing economies, leading to catastrophic hunger, massive displacement, and disease outbreaks[23]. The inability to deliver life-saving aid and essential services due to inadequate resources perpetuates cycles of suffering and worsens existing emergencies[55]. There is a reliance solely on humanitarian efforts, which falls short in the long term[23]. To enhance the effectiveness of support, there is a need for more flexible funding mechanisms, such as multi-year funding and reduced restrictions on fund allocation[24].\n\nThe Grand Bargain, an agreement on humanitarian reform, emphasizes that localization is key to preventing conflicts and reducing vulnerability. It highlights the importance of collaborating closely with local actors to empower them rather than replace them, which is vital for reducing vulnerability and enhancing local capacity[56]. While actions such as distributing cash assistance digitally to vulnerable households for preparation, disseminating early warning messages, and coordinating with local government for evacuation are described, they do not specifically mention Cyclone Remal or Bangladesh in relation to the Grand Bargain[57].\n\nIn response to Cyclone Remal, which poses a significant threat to nearly 1 million Rohingya people in the world's largest refugee camp, the World Food Programme (WFP) provided 3,400 Rohingya refugees with fortified biscuits[19][20].

The cyclone is projected to make landfall between Kolkata, India, and Patuakhali, Bangladesh, from midnight on May 26 to the early morning of May 27, 2024[59][60]. In anticipation, the BMD issued Danger Signal 10 for several coastal districts, including Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Pirojpur, Jhalokathi, Barguna, Barishal, Bhola, and Patuakhali, as well as their offshore islands and chars[59][60]. Azizur Rahman, Director of the BMD, reported that Cyclone Remal had begun crossing the Bangladesh coast, with maximum wind speeds recorded at 90 kilometers per hour, potentially increasing further[61][62].\n\nThe cyclone is expected to bring maximum wind speeds of 100-110 km/h, with some forecasts predicting winds of 110-120 km/h and gusts up to 135 km/h[59][60][11]. Heavy rainfall is anticipated, posing risks of floods, flash floods, and landslides[59][60]. The storm surge could reach up to 12 feet (four meters) above normal astronomical tide, threatening the low-lying coastal areas[61][12][14]. These areas, including Satkhira, Khulna, Bagerhat, Pirojpur, Jhalokathi, Barguna, Bhola, Patuakhali, Barishal, Noakhali, Lakshmipur, Feni, Cumilla, Chattogram, and Cox's Bazar, face a critical threat of inundation from a wind-driven surge of 3-5 feet above normal tide[59][60][14].\n\nLocal mobilization is crucial for cyclone preparedness, with World Vision Bangladesh (WVB) playing a significant role. Over 1,400 community-based groups and nearly 3,000 WVB volunteers are actively involved in disseminating early warning messages and preparing communities[6][9][63]. Additionally, 10,000 youth and child forum members are being informed and prepared to take action[63]. Awareness campaigns are ongoing to equip families with the knowledge to protect themselves and their belongings[63].\n\nThe Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) has conducted an impact analysis, highlighting that up to 1.9 million people are at risk, with an exposed population of 11 million in areas expecting wind speeds of 110-120 km/h[12]. NAWG, under the Humanitarian Coordination Task Team (HCTT), compiles information from sources like the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and BMD for preparatory activities[12][13][14][15][16].\n\nUNICEF has contingency partnerships with civil society organizations ready for rapid response in cyclone-affected areas, with 19 partnerships available for reprogramming if necessary[17][18]. Coordination with the Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) and local government is essential for evacuating at-risk communities[57].\n\nCurrent gaps in early warning systems pose challenges for cyclone preparedness in Bangladesh, a country with limited resources[54]. Accurate forecasts require comprehensive data from all regional countries, but a significant data gap exists due to unavailable weather data from exclusive economic zones[32]. This lack of data hinders timely evacuations, increasing vulnerability in lower-income countries[32][29][50].\n\nTo mitigate the impact of Cyclone Remal, the World Food Programme (WFP) has provided fortified biscuits to 3,400 Rohingya refugees in the world's largest refugee camp, where nearly 1 million people are at risk[19][20].

            "cluster_summary": "Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, are increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events, facing escalating climate-related threats such as cyclones, landslides, and floods[1][64][3][2]. The region's susceptibility to these hazards is compounded by the broader challenges faced by Bangladesh, including the health implications of water salinity and extreme heat in areas like Khulna. The water crisis in Khulna, characterized by saline intrusion, has led to a shortage of clean and safe water, forcing residents to use saline water for daily needs, which poses significant health risks, including kidney disease[41][43][40][42][44]. Extreme heat further exacerbates health issues, leading to increased hospital admissions due to dehydration and related conditions[41][44].\n\nIn response to Cyclone Remal, Bangladesh has implemented extensive measures to protect its population. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) issued Danger Signal 10 for several coastal districts, anticipating severe impacts with wind speeds potentially reaching 110-120 km/h and storm surges up to 12 feet above normal tide[59][60][11][61][62][14]. To mitigate these risks, fishing operations were suspended, and fishermen were advised to avoid the Bay of Bengal during critical periods[65][66][67][68]. Emergency medical teams have been established, and 706 Government Primary Schools have been converted into cyclone shelters[49]. Additionally, World Vision Bangladesh (WVB) and other organizations have mobilized resources and volunteers to support vulnerable communities, with efforts including the distribution of relief materials and the activation of Emergency Operation Centers[6][9][10][8][63].\n\nThe Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) conducted an impact analysis, projecting that up to 1.9 million people are at risk, with an exposed population of 11 million in areas facing high wind speeds[12]. This analysis, based on data from the India Meteorological Department and BMD, informs preparatory activities but is not official government information[15][16]. The World Food Programme (WFP) has also been active, providing forecast-based cash assistance to help families procure essential items and reinforce their homes[33][37][36]. WFP's anticipatory action initiatives aim to enhance food security and nutrition in the face of extreme weather[34][38][39].\n\nDespite these efforts, the global humanitarian funding crisis poses significant challenges, with a widening gap between needs and available resources, exacerbated by conflicts, climate emergencies, and economic instability[21][23][22]. This shortfall limits the ability to deliver life-saving aid and essential services, highlighting the need for more flexible funding mechanisms[55][24]. Coordination with local government and the Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) has been crucial in evacuating at-risk communities, although gaps in early warning systems remain a concern[57][32][29].\n\nTo reduce vulnerability to cyclones and other climate-related disasters, measures such as poverty reduction, infrastructure improvements, and enhanced early warning systems are essential[27][29][32]. These efforts, combined with strong governance and international cooperation, can help build resilience and protect vulnerable populations in Bangladesh and beyond[26][28][30].",

Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh, with floods being the primary driver, recorded the highest number of disaster displacements in 2022. Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh, hosting about a million Rohingya refugees, faces escalating climate-related threats, impacting camp life, safety during irregular movement, and prospects for return to Myanmar. While initial displacement from Myanmar was driven by persecution and conflicts, the dire conditions in refugee camps are increasingly influenced by climate factors, potentially contributing to onward movements to neighbouring countries like India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.The emerging impact of climate change on the displacement and migration dynamics of Rohingya is increasingly relevant.",

Displaced populations like the Rohingya are particularly susceptible to secondary displacement due to settling in hazard-prone areas, exacerbating the risk of climate-related movement on a larger scale. The combination of food insecurity, violence, lack of livelihoods, and dwindling hope for durable solutions has led to a surge in irregular maritime movement of Rohingya across the region in recent months.Though conflict remains the primary driver of Rohingya displacement, climate and environmental factors along with the deteriorating conditions in the camps significantly exacerbates migration risks, particularly during perilous sea journeys.",

Fishing operations have been completely suspended, with advisories issued for fishermen to avoid venturing into the central Bay of Bengal until May 26th, and into the North Bay of Bengal until May 27th. Additionally, fishermen are advised to stay away from the south Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea until May 27th, and from the North Bay of Bengal from May 25th to May 27th[65][66][67][68].\n\nThe BMD has reported that a depression in the Bay of Bengal is expected to intensify into a severe cyclone named REMAL, projected to make landfall between Kolkata, India, and Patuakhali, Bangladesh, from the night of May 26th to the early morning of May 27th, 2024[59][60]. In anticipation of the cyclone, Danger Signal 10 has been issued for the coastal districts of Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Pirojpur, Jhalokathi, Barguna, Barishal, Bhola, Patuakhali, and their offshore islands and chars[59][60]. BMD Director Azizur Rahman has indicated that Cyclone Remal has begun crossing the Bangladesh coast and may continue to impact the area until at least the early hours of Monday morning, with recorded maximum wind speeds of 90 kilometers per hour and the potential for increased intensity[61][62].\n\nThe cyclone is expected to bring severe weather conditions to the coastal districts, with maximum wind speeds potentially reaching 100-110 km/h during peak impact times, and some forecasts suggesting winds could escalate to 110-120 kilometers per hour with gusts up to 135 kilometers per hour[59][60][11]. Heavy rainfall is anticipated, posing risks of floods, flash floods, and landslides[59][60]. The cyclone could also generate a storm surge of up to 12 feet (four meters) above the normal astronomical tide, which is considered dangerous[61], or between 8-12 feet above normal tide[14].

However, this interpretation is not directly linked to Cyclone Remal in Bangladesh.\n\nIn preparation for an impending cyclone, coordination with the Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) and local government was crucial for evacuating at-risk communities[57]. The Grand Bargain, an agreement on humanitarian reform, underscores the importance of localization to prevent conflicts and reduce vulnerability, emphasizing collaboration with local actors to empower them rather than replace them[56]. This approach is vital for reducing vulnerability and enhancing local capacity[56]. Actions taken before a cyclone included distributing cash assistance digitally to vulnerable households, disseminating early warning messages, and coordinating with local government for evacuation[57]. However, these actions are not specifically linked to Cyclone Remal or Bangladesh in the context of the Grand Bargain.\n\nCyclone Remal poses a significant threat to nearly 1 million Rohingya people in the world's largest refugee camp[19]. In response, the World Food Programme (WFP) provided 3,400 Rohingya refugees with fortified biscuits[20]. Ongoing needs assessments are being conducted to update and determine the extent of potential damage caused by the cyclone[19].\n\nThe Common Feedback Platform (CFP) aims to enhance Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) and inform programming within the Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh Rohingya response[58]. This joint inter-agency report offers an overview of community feedback raised in this response[58].

This preparedness is crucial in the context of a global humanitarian funding crisis, which is marked by a lack of quick solutions[21] and a significant funding shortfall[22]. This shortfall has resulted in humanitarian organizations failing to meet their targets in 2023, reaching less than two-thirds of the people they aimed to support[21]. Consequently, response plans for 2024 are ultra-prioritized with extremely tightened budgets[21].\n\nThe challenges faced by humanitarian efforts are multifaceted. There is a widening gap between needs and response, exacerbated by conflicts, climate emergencies, and collapsing economies, leading to catastrophic hunger, massive displacement, and disease outbreaks[23]. The inability to deliver life-saving aid and essential services due to inadequate resources perpetuates cycles of suffering and worsens existing emergencies[55]. Sole reliance on humanitarian efforts is insufficient in the long term[23]. To enhance the effectiveness of support, there is a pressing need for more flexible funding mechanisms, such as multi-year funding and reduced restrictions on fund allocation[24].\n\nThe Grand Bargain, an agreement on humanitarian reform, underscores the importance of localization as a key strategy to prevent conflicts and reduce vulnerability[56]. It emphasizes the need to collaborate closely with local actors to empower them rather than replace them, which is vital for reducing vulnerability and enhancing local capacity[56]. Actions taken before a cyclone, such as distributing cash assistance digitally to vulnerable households for preparation, disseminating early warning messages, and coordinating with local government for evacuation, illustrate the importance of these collaborative efforts[57].
