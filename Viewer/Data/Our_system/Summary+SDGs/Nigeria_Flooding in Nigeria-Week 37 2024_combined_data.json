    "summary": "Borno State, Nigeria, is grappling with severe flooding, described as the worst in 30 years, primarily caused by heavy rainfall and the collapse or overflow of the Alau Dam on the Ngadda River around September 10, 2024[79]. This disaster has affected over 414,000 people as of September 11, 2024, with more than 230,000 to 400,000 individuals displaced and registered in relocation sites[18]. At least 37 people have died and 58 sustained injuries[52], while thousands of homes, infrastructure, schools, hospitals, and markets have been submerged or their access hampered, with 15% to 50% of Maiduguri city underwater[66]. The flooding exacerbates a pre-existing humanitarian crisis, including armed conflict, widespread malnutrition, and a failing economy, occurring during the lean season and leading to shortages of food and water, alongside a heightened risk of disease outbreaks like cholera and malaria[26]. In response, evacuation of high-risk areas is ongoing, and search and rescue operations are underway by government agencies, military, and local divers[31]. The UN and its partners, including WFP, UNICEF, and WHO, are providing emergency food assistance, hot meals, shelter, water, health services, and hygiene kits, while appealing for additional support to address the escalating humanitarian crisis[22]. Although floodwaters are beginning to recede in some areas, many residents' homes remain flooded, and the overall situation requires immediate action[18].",

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reports that the displaced population includes 157,274 individuals, highlighting the urgent need for safe shelter, psychosocial support, and healthcare services[10][11][12]. The humanitarian community is called to act swiftly, with DTM Nigeria conducting rapid assessments within 24-48 hours to document the event and assess urgent needs[10]. Emergency response teams are deployed to the most affected areas, emphasizing the necessity of a comprehensive response to ensure all affected individuals receive the required assistance[13][14].\n\nThe flooding has exacerbated the existing humanitarian crisis in a region already suffering from the Boko Haram insurgency, creating a \"crisis within a crisis\" with conflict, record food price inflation, and floods displacing hundreds of thousands of people[15][16]. The State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) is coordinating rescue operations, deploying resources such as boats, canoes, local divers, military, and fire trucks[17]. SEMA, in partnership with WFP and INTERSOS, has scaled up its hot meals program in the Teachers' Village and Yerwa camps, while the Nigerian military has activated 22 disaster response units to reach inaccessible areas and conduct search and rescue operations[18][19].\n\nHumanitarian agencies face significant challenges in accessing flood-affected areas due to collapsed infrastructure, such as the Gwange and Lagos Street bridges, and insecurity in the region[15]. This has disrupted essential health services, including vaccinations and regular medical consultations[20]. UNICEF is addressing health and nutrition needs in Maiduguri's flood evacuation sites by supporting three sites: Bakassi, Dalori, and Teachers Village, providing nutrition services and establishing health centers in partnership with MSF[21]. Additionally, UNICEF has prepositioned malaria and cholera detection and treatment kits and distributed kits for acute watery diarrhea to affected communities[20].\n\nEfforts to distribute food, shelter, and WASH supplies are underway, with Malteser International distributing cholera prevention and hygiene kits in Bakasi refugee camp[22][23][24][7][4]. The UN and NGO partners are utilizing helicopters to deliver life-saving assistance to communities cut off by the flood[25]. The Yobe State Emergency Management Authority (SEMA), in collaboration with the Nigerian Red Cross, is conducting rapid needs assessments to inform the humanitarian response[24]. President Bola Tinubu has ordered massive evacuations and committed to relief efforts[4].\n\nStrategic and tactical questions are being considered to address the humanitarian situation, including the primary needs and vulnerabilities of the affected population, the risk of disease outbreaks, and the extent of losses sustained by residents[26][27][5]. There is also a focus on improving infrastructure and early warning systems to prevent future disasters and enhance the effectiveness of emergency relief efforts[28][29]. The humanitarian response aims to address the exacerbation of the food and nutrition crisis, especially for the 4.8 million people in dire need in conflict-affected areas[30].\n\nThe humanitarian community is also exploring how to secure more resources and global support to save lives and plan for longer-term recovery[31]. International cooperation and financial support are crucial to building Nigeria's resilience against climate-induced disasters[29]. The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation (FMHAPA) is supporting states to evacuate people at risk, while UNICEF and other aid organizations are providing essential relief items and support for unaccompanied children and disabled persons[32][33][34].",

            "cluster_summary": "The devastating floods in Maiduguri have displaced 157,274 individuals, leaving thousands homeless and in urgent need of assistance[1][10]. The immediate priorities for these affected populations include securing safe shelter, providing crucial psychosocial support, and ensuring access to first aid and healthcare services[11][12]. In response to this crisis, the humanitarian community is urged to act swiftly, with DTM Nigeria conducting rapid assessments within the first 24-48 hours to document the event's impact and the urgent needs of those affected[10]. Emergency response teams are deployed to the hardest-hit areas, emphasizing the necessity of a comprehensive response to ensure all affected individuals receive the required assistance[13][14].\n\nStrategic and tactical questions have been raised to address the humanitarian situation in Nigeria due to severe flooding. These include identifying the primary needs, vulnerabilities, and mobility intentions of the affected population[26], assessing the risk of disease outbreaks from contaminated water, and preventing further outbreaks of waterborne and communicable diseases[27]. Additionally, there is a need to evaluate the findings and recommendations from the technical assessment of the Alau Dam situation and the extent of the flood disaster[5]. The challenges of funding and logistics that have hindered the evacuation of people trapped in submerged areas are also critical concerns[26]. Furthermore, emergency measures must be activated to mitigate the impact of probable future flooding in regions like the Niger Delta and other southern states[26], and the extent of losses sustained by residents, along with their recovery needs as floodwaters recede, must be assessed[5].\n\nEfforts to distribute food, shelter, and WASH supplies are underway, with Malteser International distributing cholera prevention and hygiene kits in Bakasi refugee camp[22][23][24][7][4]. The UN and NGO partners are utilizing helicopters to deliver life-saving assistance to communities cut off by the flood[25]. The Yobe State Emergency Management Authority, in collaboration with the Nigerian Red Cross, is conducting a rapid needs assessment to inform the humanitarian response[24]. Heads of UN agencies, NGOs, and the Nigerian Red Cross Society have committed to supporting government efforts and mobilizing additional resources for the lifesaving response[7][4]. In Adamawa, relief assistance is being provided by the state government, UN agencies, and partners[24], while President Bola Tinubu has ordered massive evacuations and committed to relief efforts[4].\n\nThe humanitarian response also involves addressing policy and infrastructure challenges. Questions include how to integrate climate adaptation with disaster risk management, build a more resilient disaster management framework, and develop adequate infrastructure to manage water flow and handle heavy rainfall[35][28][36]. Enhancing early warning systems for floods and ensuring effective communication to communities and stakeholders are also crucial[28]. The humanitarian response must ensure efficient aid distribution, expedite search and rescue operations, and provide essential relief items to prevent disease outbreaks[35][36][37]. Long-term recovery strategies are needed for those pushed into poverty by the destruction of homes and livelihoods, and the protection of vulnerable groups such as unaccompanied children and disabled persons must be ensured[31][33]. The response must also address the exacerbation of the food and nutrition crisis, especially for the 4.8 million people in dire need in conflict-affected areas[30].\n\nUNICEF is actively addressing health and nutrition needs in Maiduguri's flood evacuation sites by supporting three sites: Bakassi, Dalori, and Teachers Village[21]. Health centers established in these camps provide nutrition services, including screening and treatment of severe malnutrition[21]. UNICEF, along with other aid organizations, has also established a one-stop center in Bakassi camp offering family tracing for unaccompanied and separated children, gender-based violence support, and psychosocial support[34]. Additionally, UNICEF has prepositioned malaria and cholera detection and treatment kits in flood-affected regions and distributed kits for acute watery diarrhea to affected communities[20]. Healthcare kits for 4,000 people have also been provided[38][39][20].\n\nThe immediate needs of the affected households in Maiduguri camps, as identified by a rapid needs assessment, include food, shelter, and clean water[40][41]. This assessment was conducted by the Rapid Response Mechanism in coordination with OCHA and the AAWG, and involved an interagency aerial assessment by WFP using UN humanitarian air service helicopters[41][42].",

            "cluster_summary": "The severe flooding in Maiduguri has displaced 157,274 individuals, leaving thousands homeless and in urgent need of safe shelter, psychosocial support, and healthcare services [1][10][11][12]. The humanitarian community is under pressure to respond swiftly, with DTM Nigeria conducting rapid assessments within 24-48 hours to document the event's impact and the urgent needs of those affected [10]. Emergency response teams have been deployed to the most affected areas, emphasizing the necessity of a comprehensive response to ensure all individuals receive the required assistance [13][14].\n\nThe response is complicated by concurrent outbreaks of Diphtheria, Cerebrospinal Meningitis (CSM), and Lassa fever, which have hindered coordination among stakeholders [43]. This lack of coordination affects the implementation of an effective strategy to combat these outbreaks [43]. The humanitarian situation in Nigeria, exacerbated by the floods, raises several strategic and tactical questions. These include understanding the primary needs and vulnerabilities of the affected population, assessing the risk of disease outbreaks from contaminated water, and determining the funding and logistical challenges that impede evacuation efforts [27][26][5].\n\nThe State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) is coordinating rescue operations using resources such as boats, canoes, local divers, military, and fire trucks [17]. However, there is a need for additional medical supplies and support, as well as more resources to save lives and respond to the crises [44][45]. Mobile clinics, medical supplies, and doctors from the military hospital have been deployed to attend to the displaced in camps, and water trucks are providing clean water to prevent water-borne diseases [46][47][48][49]. Organizations like Malteser International are focused on providing potable water and cholera prevention [50].\n\nDespite efforts to provide food and non-food items in camps, there is a shortage of essential supplies, leading to a rush for food [51][52]. The deployment of water trucks and mobile water treatment plants aims to control water-borne diseases, while addressing open defecation is crucial to reducing the transmission of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) [49][53]. The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation (FMHAPA) is supporting states in evacuating people at risk [32].\n\nUNICEF is addressing health and nutrition needs in flood evacuation sites by supporting Bakassi, Dalori, and Teachers Village camps, establishing health centers in partnership with MSF, and providing nutrition services and psycho-social support [21][34]. UNICEF has also prepositioned malaria and cholera detection kits and distributed kits for acute watery diarrhea to affected communities [38][39][20].\n\nThe flooding has compounded the existing humanitarian crisis in a region already suffering from the Boko Haram insurgency, with insecurity further hindering aid efforts [15]. Maiduguri faces a \"crisis within a crisis,\" with conflict, record food price inflation, and floods displacing hundreds of thousands, many of whom are cut off from their farms [16]. Addressing these challenges requires optimizing federal assistance and collaboration with state authorities, implementing comprehensive flood mitigation measures, and mobilizing funding from various sources to address critical needs and gaps in the flood response [54][55].",

The humanitarian community is called to act swiftly, with DTM Nigeria conducting rapid assessments within 24-48 hours post-incident to document the event's impact and the urgent needs of those affected [10]. Emergency response teams are deployed to the most affected areas, emphasizing the necessity of a comprehensive response to ensure all individuals receive the required assistance [13][14].\n\nStrategic and tactical questions arise in addressing the humanitarian situation, such as identifying the primary needs and vulnerabilities of the affected population, assessing the risk of disease outbreaks from contaminated water, and determining the funding requirements and logistical challenges for evacuating people from submerged areas [27][26][5]. As floodwaters recede, residents begin returning to assess their losses, though specific plans to support their return remain unclear [5][56].\n\nEfforts to distribute essential supplies are underway, with Malteser International providing cholera prevention and hygiene kits in Bakasi refugee camp [22][23][24][7][4]. The UN and NGO partners utilize helicopters to deliver life-saving assistance to isolated communities [25]. The Yobe State Emergency Management Authority, in collaboration with the Nigerian Red Cross, conducts rapid needs assessments to inform the humanitarian response [24]. Additionally, President Bola Tinubu has ordered massive evacuations and committed to relief efforts [4].\n\nInfrastructure challenges, such as inadequate drainage systems and poor urban planning, exacerbate the flooding's impact, affecting essential services like communication, power, and water supply [57][30][58][59]. The State Emergency Management Agency coordinates rescue operations using resources like boats and local divers [17]. To control water-borne diseases, clean water is provided through water trucks, and organizations like Malteser International focus on cholera prevention and improving sanitation practices [49][53][50]. Mobile clinics staffed by military hospital doctors offer medical care to displaced individuals in camps [48][47].\n\nImmediate plans for Borno State include rehabilitating sanitation facilities and providing emergency shelter [60][61]. The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation supports states in relocating and rehabilitating displaced people [32]. UNICEF addresses health and nutrition needs in flood evacuation sites by establishing health centers in Bakassi, Dalori, and Teachers Village, offering services like malnutrition screening and treatment [21]. They also provide family tracing, GBV support, and psychosocial services [34]. UNICEF has prepositioned malaria and cholera detection kits and distributed kits for acute watery diarrhea to affected communities [38][39][20].\n\nThe rapid needs assessment identifies food, shelter, and clean water as immediate needs for households in Maiduguri camps [40][41]. This assessment, coordinated with OCHA and the AAWG, involved an interagency aerial assessment by WFP using UN humanitarian air service helicopters [41][42]. The humanitarian response continues to face challenges, including insecurity in the region, which hinders aid efforts [15].",

            "cluster_summary": "The catastrophic flooding in Maiduguri, Borno State, North-east Nigeria, has displaced over 239,000 residents, with the collapse of the Alau Dam on the Ngadda River being a significant contributing factor[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reports that the floodwaters have submerged buildings and left thousands homeless[1][3]. The affected population, including 157,274 displaced individuals, urgently requires safe shelter, psychosocial support, and healthcare services[10][11][12]. The humanitarian community is called to act swiftly, with DTM Nigeria conducting rapid assessments within 24-48 hours to document the event and assess urgent needs[10]. Emergency response teams are deployed to the most affected areas, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive response to ensure all affected individuals receive necessary assistance[13][14].\n\nThe flooding has caused extensive damage to infrastructure, property, and homes, with thousands of homes submerged and vast parts of Maiduguri underwater[64][66][65][25]. Public buildings, including government agencies, the Government House, Monday Market, and parts of the University of Maiduguri, have been affected, and cemeteries have been breached, with corpses seen floating in the floodwaters[25]. Roads and transport networks have been destroyed, disrupting access to hospitals, schools, and markets, while local telecommunications and electricity networks have been compromised[22][25]. The main market, Monday Market, remains flooded, further complicating relief efforts[25].\n\nIn response, various organizations are distributing essential supplies. Malteser International is providing cholera prevention and hygiene kits in Bakasi refugee camp[22][23][24][7][4]. The UN and NGO partners are using helicopters to deliver life-saving assistance to isolated communities[25]. The Yobe State Emergency Management Authority (SEMA) and the Nigerian Red Cross are conducting rapid needs assessments to inform the humanitarian response[24]. President Bola Tinubu has ordered massive evacuations and committed to relief efforts[4].\n\nStrategic and tactical questions have been raised to address the humanitarian situation, focusing on the affected population's primary needs, disease outbreak risks, and the technical assessment of the Alau Dam[27][26][5]. Funding requirements and logistical challenges for evacuations, emergency measures for future flooding, and recovery needs as floodwaters recede are also being considered[26][5]. The humanitarian response must also address the exacerbation of the food and nutrition crisis, especially for the 4.8 million people in dire need in conflict-affected areas[30].\n\nRescue operations are ongoing, with at least 3,683 people rescued using boats, canoes, local divers, military, and fire trucks[17]. The State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) coordinates these efforts, deploying resources to reach trapped individuals[17]. The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation (FMHAPA) supports states in evacuating people at risk[32]. Coordination efforts include NEMA conducting Emergency Coordination Forum meetings and activating the Emergency Operation Centre to respond to the flood situation[68][69].\n\nImmediate plans to address the damage in Borno State include rehabilitating sanitation facilities and providing emergency shelter[60][61]. UNICEF is addressing health and nutrition needs in flood evacuation sites by supporting health centers in Bakassi, Dalori, and Teachers Village, offering nutrition services and family tracing for unaccompanied children[21][34]. UNICEF has also prepositioned malaria and cholera detection kits and distributed kits for acute watery diarrhea to affected communities[20].\n\nThe flooding has worsened the existing humanitarian crisis in a region already suffering from the Boko Haram insurgency, with insecurity hindering aid efforts[15]. Maiduguri faces a \"crisis within a crisis,\" with conflict, record food price inflation, and floods displacing hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom were already cut off from their farms[16]. SEMA, in partnership with WFP and INTERSOS, has scaled up its hot meals program in the Teachers' Village and Yerwa camps, while the Nigerian military has activated disaster response units to help reach inaccessible areas and conduct search and rescue operations[18][19].",

The humanitarian community is under pressure to respond swiftly, with DTM Nigeria conducting rapid assessments within 24-48 hours to document the event's impact and the urgent needs of those affected [10]. Emergency response teams have been deployed to the most affected areas, highlighting the necessity for a comprehensive response to ensure all affected individuals receive the required assistance [13][14].\n\nThe flooding has caused catastrophic damage to infrastructure, property, and homes, submerging thousands of residences and leaving vast parts of Maiduguri underwater [64][66][65][25]. Key public buildings and areas, including the Government House, Monday Market, and parts of the University of Maiduguri, have been affected, with cemeteries breached and corpses seen floating in the floodwaters [66][25]. The destruction extends to roads and transport networks, severely restricting access to hospitals, schools, and markets, and disrupting local telecommunications and electricity networks [22][25]. The main market, Monday Market, remains flooded, further complicating the situation [25].\n\nIn response to these challenges, strategic and tactical questions have been raised to address the humanitarian situation. These include assessing the primary needs and vulnerabilities of the affected population, preventing disease outbreaks from contaminated water, and evaluating the Alau Dam's condition [27][26][5]. Additionally, there is a need to address funding requirements and logistical challenges for evacuating people from submerged areas and to implement emergency measures to mitigate future flooding impacts [26][5].\n\nThe State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) and the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation (FMHAPA) are coordinating rescue operations, deploying resources such as boats, canoes, and local divers to rescue trapped individuals [17][32][70]. Immediate plans include rehabilitating sanitation facilities and providing emergency shelter for displaced people [60][61]. UNICEF and other aid organizations are addressing health and nutrition needs in flood evacuation sites, establishing health centers and providing essential services like family tracing, gender-based violence support, and psychosocial support [21][34].\n\nThe flooding has exacerbated the existing humanitarian crisis in a region already suffering from the Boko Haram insurgency, with insecurity further hindering aid efforts [15]. Maiduguri faces a \"crisis within a crisis,\" with conflict, record food price inflation, and floods displacing hundreds of thousands, many of whom were already cut off from their farms [16]. Humanitarian agencies face challenges accessing flood-affected areas due to collapsed infrastructure and insecurity, limiting the provision of essential health services [20][15].\n\nTo address these issues, questions have been raised about optimizing federal assistance, implementing comprehensive flood mitigation measures, and managing the \"crisis within a crisis\" holistically [71][54][72]. There is also a focus on improving infrastructure and early warning systems, enhancing government emergency relief efforts, and securing international cooperation and resources to build resilience against climate-induced disasters [35][28][36][29]. The ongoing rescue operation has successfully saved at least 3,683 people, with efforts continuing to reach those still trapped [17].",

The collapse of the Alau Dam on the Ngadda River in Maiduguri, Borno State, North-east Nigeria, has exacerbated the crisis by submerging buildings and displacing over 239,000 residents[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. This displacement, reported by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), was directly caused by the floodwaters from the Alau Dam[3][56].\n\nThe flooding has significantly damaged approximately 110,000 hectares of farmland in Borno State, although the estimated economic loss from this destruction is not specified[62][63][3]. The State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) is actively coordinating rescue operations, deploying resources such as boats, canoes, local divers, military, and fire trucks to assist those trapped in submerged areas[17]. However, logistical challenges and funding requirements have hampered evacuation efforts[26].\n\nIn response to the immediate needs, there is an urgent requirement for emergency shelter and the rehabilitation of sanitation facilities in the damaged areas of Borno State[60][61]. The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation (FMHAPA) is supporting states in the relocation and rehabilitation of displaced people[32]. Additionally, emergency measures must be activated to mitigate the impact of probable future flooding in regions like the Niger Delta and other southern states[26].\n\nThe risk of disease outbreaks, particularly from contaminated water, is a pressing concern, and strategies to prevent further outbreaks of waterborne and communicable diseases are critical[27]. The technical assessment of the Alau Dam situation and the extent of the flood disaster has provided findings and recommendations that are essential for addressing these challenges[5].\n\nThe flooding has compounded the existing humanitarian crisis in a region already suffering from the Boko Haram insurgency, with aid efforts hindered by insecurity[15]. Maiduguri is experiencing a \"crisis within a crisis,\" as conflict, record food price inflation, and floods have displaced hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom were already cut off from their farms[16].

While specific strategies to enhance coordination for these outbreaks are not detailed, efforts are being made to address other emergencies, such as the severe flooding affecting the region.\n\nThe State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) plays a crucial role in coordinating rescue operations, deploying resources like boats, canoes, local divers, military, and fire trucks to manage the flood crisis[17]. The Borno State Government (BSG) has also launched search and rescue operations in areas isolated by flash floods, with support from the military and private individuals providing boats and canoes, and partners using helicopters to deliver food to those cut off[74]. Additionally, the acting Zonal Coordinator, North-East of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Surajo Garba, has emphasized efforts to supply food and non-food items to displaced individuals in camps[51].\n\nCoordination efforts are further supported by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), which conducts Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) meetings with stakeholders, activates the Emergency Operation Centre (EOC), and holds sector meetings to address the flood situation[68]. The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation (FMHAPA) collaborates with state governments and SEMAs to conduct needs assessments and evacuate people at risk[69]. Planned support for Naval Disaster Response Units (DRUs) includes providing boats and life jackets for marine rescue operations[75].\n\nA mission involving UN agency heads, NGO directors, and donors met with the Governor of Borno and other officials to discuss the crisis, with WHO and international partners pledging support[76][32][61]. ActionAid Nigeria is also collaborating with local governments and international partners to enhance response efforts[77]. In other flood-affected states, weekly meetings with the Ministry of Health are conducted to coordinate health services[68].\n\nHumanitarian agencies face significant challenges in accessing flood-affected areas, with limited access for mobile outreach disrupting essential health services like vaccinations and medical consultations[20]. Insecurity and infrastructure damage, such as the collapse of key bridges in Maiduguri, further restrict access[15]. Many communities remain isolated, with telecommunications and electricity networks disconnected[15].\n\nThe immediate needs of affected households in Maiduguri camps, identified through a rapid needs assessment, include food, shelter, and clean water[40][41]. This assessment was coordinated by the Rapid Response Mechanism with OCHA and the AAWG, and involved an interagency aerial assessment by WFP using UNHAS helicopters[41][42].\n\nThe flooding exacerbates the existing humanitarian crisis in a region already suffering from the Boko Haram insurgency, creating a \"crisis within a crisis\" as conflict, record food price inflation, and floods displace hundreds of thousands, many of whom are cut off from their farms[15][16]. SEMA is actively setting up and managing temporary camps in Maiduguri, conducting search and rescue operations, and, in partnership with WFP and INTERSOS, scaling up hot meals programs in camps like Teachers' Village and Yerwa[18]. The Nigerian military has activated 22 disaster response units in Borno and across north-east Nigeria to reach inaccessible areas and conduct search and rescue operations for those trapped by flooding[18][19].",

            "cluster_summary": "The severe flooding in Maiduguri has displaced 157,274 individuals, leaving thousands homeless and in urgent need of assistance[1][10]. The immediate priorities for these affected populations include securing safe shelter, providing crucial psychosocial support, and ensuring access to first aid and healthcare services[11][12]. The humanitarian community is urged to respond swiftly, with DTM Nigeria conducting rapid assessments within 24-48 hours post-incident to document the event, assess urgent needs, and gather demographic information[10]. Emergency response teams are deployed to the most affected areas, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive response to ensure all affected individuals receive necessary aid[13][14].\n\nThe coordination of the response is challenged by concurrent outbreaks of Diphtheria, Cerebrospinal Meningitis (CSM), and Lassa fever, which complicate the implementation of an effective strategy[43]. The State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) is actively coordinating rescue operations, utilizing resources such as boats, canoes, local divers, military, and fire trucks[17]. Coordination efforts are further managed through an Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) and sector meetings led by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA)[78]. A mission involving UN agency heads, NGO directors, and donors has engaged with local government officials to bolster the response[32]. WHO and other international partners have pledged support, working closely with health authorities to address the crisis[76][61]. ActionAid Nigeria collaborates with local governments and international partners, while weekly meetings with the Ministry of Health are held in other flood-affected states[77][68].\n\nStrategic questions arise regarding optimizing federal assistance and collaboration with state authorities to address both immediate and long-term needs, implementing effective flood mitigation measures, and managing the compounded crisis of conflict, food price inflation, and flooding in Maiduguri[71][54][72]. Additionally, there is a need to effectively mobilize and allocate funding from various sources to address critical needs and gaps in the flood response[55].\n\nTactically, the Rapid Needs Assessment Report identifies immediate needs for over 300,000 displaced people in 30 relocation sites, emphasizing the restoration and maintenance of access to affected areas, given the collapse of key infrastructure like bridges[15][79][80][34][54]. Specific WASH interventions are necessary to prevent outbreaks of communicable diseases, and there is a need to scale the provision of hot meals and specialized nutritious foods by WFP and partners[34][72]. Efforts to mitigate the expected increase in malaria and other vector-borne diseases are also crucial[15]. Coordination between the Nigerian military's disaster response units and SEMA is essential to maximize search and rescue operations, especially in inaccessible areas[79]. Additionally, managing risks posed by escaped animals from the Maiduguri Zoo and overcoming challenges posed by regional insecurity are critical to ensuring community safety and effective aid delivery[15].\n\nHumanitarian agencies face significant challenges in accessing flood-affected areas, with limited mobile outreach disrupting essential health services like vaccinations and medical consultations[20]. Insecurity further hinders aid efforts, and access is restricted due to the collapse of key infrastructure, leaving some communities isolated and without telecommunications and electricity[15].",

This is due to the concurrent outbreaks of Diphtheria, Cerebrospinal Meningitis CSM, and Lassa fever, with more attention given to diphtheria and CSM, thereby hindering the implementation of a cohesive and effective response strategy to combat the outbreak.In many affected areas, there is lack of specialized psychosocial support services, including counselling, therapy, and support groups, leaving individuals and communities without access to needed mental health care.
