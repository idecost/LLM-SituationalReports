    "summary": "Ukraine is experiencing a multifaceted crisis characterized by ongoing hostilities and significant humanitarian challenges. The Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS) continues to monitor the status of health facilities and identify service gaps[63], while nuclear safety and security, particularly at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), remain vulnerable with frequent external power outages and only one of four 750 kV power lines operational[46]. The country is still recovering from the Kakhovka Dam destruction a year prior, which resulted in devastating flooding, at least 15 deaths, damage to over 37,000 houses, and disrupted water supply for a million people[25]. Education activities in regions like Sumska, Donetska, and Kharkivska oblasts aim to restore normalcy for children amidst displacement and intensified missile attacks, with educational consultation points in Donetska oblast temporarily suspended and evacuations of families with children initiated in May 2024 due to worsening security[85][83]. Telecommunications infrastructure has also been severely affected, including a major cyberattack in December 2023 that disrupted mobile signals for millions, and temporary internet services were deployed in Odesa in May due to intensified shelling[69]. Economically, direct damage to Ukraine has reached USD 155 billion, with economic losses at USD 499 billion, and reconstruction efforts are estimated to cost over USD 486 billion[44]. Efforts are underway to address legal issues such as housing compensation[7]and provide mental health and psychosocial support to over 117,000 people[17], with calls for women's inclusive participation in reconstruction processes[13].",

They are advocating for the rights of women and girls and are essential to increase the participation of those groups in processes and decisions that affect them now and will continue to impact them after the war.",

                    "updated_retrieved_answer": "Owners of destroyed housing in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine face several legal challenges that impact their ability to receive compensation through the eRecovery program.\n\n**Legal Challenges:**\n*   **Difficulty in Property Registration:** Most Bureaus of Technical Inventory (BTIs) in temporarily occupied territories were not relocated to Government of Ukraine-controlled territory, or were damaged, destroyed, or looted, making it very difficult or impossible to obtain necessary information for state registration of property rights (SRPR)[1][2][3]. The law obliges state registrars to receive information from BTIs for state registration of rights[2][3]. Owners who acquired ownership before 2013 specifically face problems registering their rights in the SRPR, even with hard copies of title documents[4][3]. As a result, these owners often have to undergo a judicial procedure to recognize their right of ownership, which involves paying a court fee and bearing the burden of proof[1][5].\n*   **Inheritance Issues:** Notaries commonly refuse to open inheritance cases for property located in temporarily occupied territory, likely due to potential legal responsibility[5][6]. This forces heirs to apply to the court to confirm ownership in the order of inheritance, also requiring them to pay a court fee and bear the burden of proof[5][6].\n\n**Impact on eRecovery Compensation:**\n*   **Pre-condition for Application:** Registration of property rights in the SRPR is a pre-condition to apply for compensation through the eRecovery program[4][3]. The aforementioned difficulties in registration directly impede an owner's ability to meet this requirement.\n*   **Program Scope Limitation:** The eRecovery program would provide compensation for housing in temporarily occupied territories *only* in cases of destruction, because determining the degree of damage to housing based on satellite images is not possible[4][3].\n*   **Program Expansion Status:** While there are plans to expand the eRecovery program to other temporarily occupied territories, including Mariupol and Bakhmut[7][8], these plans are likely subject to funding support[8]. A relevant draft law is registered in the Parliament (Verkhovna Rada) and is preparing for the second reading[4].",

The Secretary-General officially listed Russia for the killing and maiming of Ukrainian children in 2023[66]. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collects information on civilian harm from conflict-related violence using a wide range of sources, such as interviews with victims, their relatives, and witnesses; open-source information; forensic records; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organizations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; and data from medical facilities and local authorities[67]. All sources and information are assessed for relevance and credibility and cross-checked[67].\n\nThe UN has been able to verify cases of harm[68], but notes that the actual extent of civilian harm, including casualties and infrastructure damage, is likely considerably higher[69]. This is due to the large number of reports and the lack of access to relevant areas, particularly from the period immediately after the full-scale armed attack[68]. Requests by the UN to access Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation are consistently denied[68]. More than 600 Ukrainian children have been killed and 1,420 injured since the escalation of Russia's invasion in February 2022[70]. Children in frontline regions have spent the equivalent of seven months underground in bomb shelters because of relentless attacks[71].\n\nIn response, the UN works with the Government to provide the care these children so desperately need[66].
