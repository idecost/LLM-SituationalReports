    "Summary": "Haiti is grappling with a worsening humanitarian crisis driven by widespread and escalating gang violence, particularly in Port-au-Prince and the Artibonite region. This violence has resulted in significant casualties, including over 3,600 killings this year and at least 70 deaths in a recent attack in Pont-Sond\u00e9, alongside widespread human rights violations like kidnappings, sexual violence, and forced child recruitment. Consequently, over 700,000 people, more than half of whom are children, are internally displaced, with many seeking refuge in overcrowded sites or with strained host families. The country also faces a severe hunger crisis, with nearly half the population (over 5 million) experiencing acute food insecurity, including 6,000 at catastrophic levels, exacerbated by gang disruptions to food supply chains, high inflation, and the lingering effects of natural disasters. Despite the UN Security Council renewing the mandate of the Kenya-led Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, it remains under-resourced and understaffed, while the overall humanitarian response is severely underfunded, with only 39% of the 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan secured, further complicated by Haiti's ongoing political instability since the 2021 assassination of President Mo\u00efse."
