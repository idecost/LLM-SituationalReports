This includes repairing and upgrading existing drainage systems, constructing new ones where needed, and developing sustainable urban planning policies that prevent construction in flood-prone areas.In addition, there must be a greater emphasis on climate change adaptation strategies. This involves creating early warning systems for floods, educating communities about the risks and responses to flooding, and investing in research to better understand the impacts of climate change on Nigeria's hydrology.International cooperation is also crucial.

Shortages of personal protective equipment PPE, inadequate training on infection prevention and control practices has compromised the safety of healthcare workers and contributed to nosocomial transmission.Additionally, coordination among various stakeholders involved in the outbreak response is quite suboptimal. This is due to the concurrent outbreaks of Diphtheria, Cerebrospinal Meningitis CSM, and Lassa fever, with more attention given to diphtheria and CSM, thereby hindering the implementation of a cohesive and effective response strategy to combat the outbreak.In many affected areas, there is lack of specialized psychosocial support services, including counselling, therapy, and support groups, leaving individuals and communities without access to needed mental health care.

  "It is a complex interplay where one issue exacerbates the other. Climate change-induced heavy rains would not cause as much devastation if there were proper infrastructure in place to manage water flow. Conversely, the impact of inadequate infrastructure is magnified by the increasing intensity of rainfall due to climate change.Nigeria's government must recognize that while they cannot control the climate, they have the power and responsibility to build resilient systems that can mitigate the effects of climate change. This involves investing in modern drainage systems, enforcing strict building codes, ensuring proper waste management, and engaging in comprehensive urban planning that considers the changing climate.Addressing Nigeria's flood problem requires a multi-faceted approach.",

A significant part of the problem lies in the government's consistent failure to develop and maintain adequate infrastructure that can handle heavy rainfall and manage water flow.
