            "title: Livelihoods Sector  content: July 2024Livelihoods sector Cash for Work guidelinesThis document intends to support Livelihoods partners who are putting Labor Intensive Programs cash- for-work into action by offering advice on the legal aspects and safety precautions of cash for work. Most significantly, though, it offers recommendations for the transfer value for daily wages. Since the economic context is always changing, the transfer value will be regularly reviewed to ensure that it remains relevant. Additionally, by utilizing this document, the sector hopes to guarantee consistency throughout the various interventions, addressing potential conflicts that may emerge from partners' employing different strategies and offering different conditions, especially the transfer value.What is Cash for Work\"Cash for Work\" CfW is a program where participants receive cash payments in exchange for performing specific types of work.",
            "This approach is often used in humanitarian and development contexts to provide immediate income support to individuals or households, while also contributing to community infrastructure and development projects. CfW programs create temporary income generation opportunities for people, especially in regions with high unemployment rates or during times of economic downturns. Furthermore, the work performed under CfW programs often involves projects that benefit the community, such as repairing roads, building schools, improving water and sanitation facilities, or cleaning up public spaces. These projects can enhance local infrastructure and services.",
            "Lastly, participants in CfW programs may acquire new skills or improve existing ones, which can enhance their employability in the future. Training and capacity-building components are sometimes included in these programs.Cash for work in LebanonFollowing the economic crisis in Lebanon in 2019, the Livelihoods sector and its partners significantly expanded labor-intensive programming to provide Cash for Work CfW opportunities to the most vulnerable community members. This initiative aimed to address the immediate needs of those severely impacted by the crisis, such as low-income families, refugees, women, youth, and people with disabilities. By offering temporary employment, CfW programs provided essential cash payments, helping participants meet their basic needs like food, rent, and healthcare.",
            "This comes from several factors: - The cash for work duration normally extends over 40 days which does not constitute fixed or long-term employment. - The sectors in which cash for work activities are implemented are those identified by the Government of Lebanon as allowed sectors agriculture, construction, and environment- cleaning joined with a lack of clear text requiring work permits in these sectors. - The administrative challenges in relation to sponsorship especially given the usually high number of beneficiaries, inability of both implementing organizations or contractors in case available to assume this role, and the time needed to obtain these permits which might exceed the initial activity timeframe.Duration of activitiesThe average number of workdays for each cash for work activity beneficiary is 40 days, 7-8 hours per day. This recommendation comes from the understanding of the labor law that reaching three months on a \"job\" entail that it is a fixed employment.",
            "However, some partners extended this duration to reach 60 days. As such, to have a meaningful intervention, the partners can apply a minimum of 40 days and a maximum of 60 days per round.Transfer value To identify and ensure a fair and meaningful transfer value, the sector considered two different variables:The Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket SMEB: a metric used to estimate the minimum cost of necessities that a household needs to survive. This typically includes essential items like food, water, shelter, and basic hygiene products. The WFP Lebanon Situation Reportii which regularly monitors and updates the SMEB in Lebanon, identified the monthly cost of the full Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket SMEB in March 2024 at LBP 36.5 million USD 403 for a family of five which was an increase by 5 percent from February of the same year.",
            "The minimum wage: the lowest amount of compensation that employers are legally required to pay their workers for their labor, typically expressed as an hourly, daily, or monthly rate. It is established by law or by contract to ensure a basic standard of living for employees and to protect workers from exploitation and unfairly low pay. The specific rate of the minimum wage is determined by government legislation. Two effective practices are recognized for integrating childcare services in CfW initiatives where women are involved.",
            "Firstly, designating one woman worker as a dedicated caregiver for children, remunerated through cash-for-work arrangements, ensures child-care provision during work activities. Secondly, allocating a budget specifically for childcare, ranging between USD 3,000 to 20,000 based on project locations, ensures sustained accessibility for women participants throughout the project duration. The childcare budget could be channelled to nurseries nearby, establishing a child-friendly space, or rehabilitating a close nursery. It is also worth noting that child-care is preferable to be close to the women'shousehold and not the project site, so women do not have to pay transportation for the child.",
            "- To enhance participation of people with disabilities, partners are recommended to provide specialized transportation or to pay an additional amount to cover specialized transportation that could be used by the person with disability. This additional amount can be determined on the actual cost that would be incurred by the beneficiary but not to exceed three dollars per working day.Transfer modalitiesThere are several modalities to conduct the cash transfer to the beneficiaries. The most common method is through financial services providers FSP. In the cases where a proxy is used, partners and beneficiaries should be aware of the protection risks resulting from this measure.",
            "This is of special importance with women, youth, and persons with disabilities. In such cases, partners are responsible for raising awareness of possible risks and conduct due diligence to ensure that beneficiaries are---willingly taking this decision. A formal delegation request must be signed by the beneficiary to facilitate the access of the proxy to the payment. Exceptionally, partners can resort to cash in hand.Payments can be made on a monthly or bi-weekly basis, which can be decided depending on the vulnerability of the beneficiaries where the most vulnerable might be in need to cash more often.",
            "Bi- weekly payments, however, pose special considerations in the project budgets as transfer fees will be twice as much of the monthly payments.Safeguards working conditions, insuranceLebanese laws and regulations do not provide for specific provisions regarding persons that work on an hourly, daily, or seasonal basis. They are also subject to the law of work accidents3iv.Below is a selected list of main topics to consider. Partners can refer to the following guidance notes for further guidance: - Gender Mainstreaming in Livelihoods Here: provides guidance and recommendations to ensure women participation and inclusion in the sectors' different activities. - Recommended Parameters on Outreach Identification and Selection Here: provides recommendation on best practices to identify and select beneficiaries.",
            "- Main principles outlined under the decent work component based on the ILO's EIIP Guidelines and safeguards HereDecent work principlesDecent Work is at the core of implementation, entailing of opportunities for work that are productive and deliver a fair income, security in the workplace and social protection for the workers and their families and equality of opportunity and treatment for all women and men. are as follows.Outreach To enhance social cohesion, and to avoid tension and discrimination in recruitment, the priority is a balance between the host and displaced community4, thus, a comprehensive outreach and communication strategy is crucial to alleviate any kind of tension that may result. Potential workers can also be identified by sharing information on upcoming with location, type of activity, number of beneficiaries with MoSA through SDCs and UNHCR through CDCs who would in turn forward information to appropriate target groups and individuals based on their vulnerability lists.Local authorities and the targeted community must be oriented towards the project and workers. Information on work conditions and the specific requirement for security screening shall be made publicArticle 7 of the Labor CodeDecree Law No.",
            "136 issued on 16 September 19835050 ratio---as early as possible. Employers must not discriminate between men and women with regards to type of work and wages or recruitment. Instead, employers should implement concrete measures to increase the participation of women and persons with disabilities. Communication campaigns targeting both displaced populations and vulnerable host community members prior to registration, are needed to attain maximum levels of transparency.Working hoursA normal working day should be eight hours, and in very exceptional cases, up to 12 hours to be compensated and considered as the exception and not the rule.",
            "During the working day and after 6 consecutive working hours for men and 5 for women, workers are entitled to one hour break according to the Lebanese Labour Law. Additionally, one full day of uninterrupted rest per week should be provided for all workers.Health and Safety Compliance with ILO's conventions and the Lebanese legislations is seen as a minimum requirement when it comes to Occupational Safety and Health OSH. Employers shall provide safety induction training or briefing to all personnel upon starting on sites, comprehensive First Aid Kits and safe drinking water should be always present, no firearms, weapons, illegal substances, or alcoholic beverages on site to be present, Personal Protective Equipment PPEs should be provided to all. Employers must cover the cost of treatment when workers are injured by accident at the workplace and provide a valid insurance policy to cover work related incidents.",
            "However, the Lebanese Labour Law prevents children under 16 years of age from working in harmful circumstances for certain types of work or activities which are deemed harmful or detrimental, and no child should be employed for more than 6 hoursday.ContractsAll beneficiaries who enter a working arrangement with the project must sign an employment contract which will allow them to work on the project. Contracts should outline the rights and obligations of the workers in a language understood by them usually Arabic; for workers that do not read and write the contract is read to them in detail.---All contracts must be submitted to the organization with a copy of the worker's identification documents and can only be accepted if the sanction list screening process5 has been performed by the contractor through the financial service provider paying out the wages. It is the contractors' responsibility to validate that Identification documents are valid prior to recruiting any worker given that payments are processed through a third-party financial institution and payments cannot be made except upon valid identification documents.Grievance mechanism The complaint mechanism within the project should be an integral part of the programme to give the opportunity for direct and indirect beneficiaries to voice their concerns anonymously and in fullconfidence.",
            "It is the role of the organization to mobilize this mechanism, ensure the confidentiality of all complaints and address those relevant as soon as possible.",
