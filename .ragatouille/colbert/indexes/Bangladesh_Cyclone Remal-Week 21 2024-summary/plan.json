This is because winds in the middle troposphere are not as strong.To make accurate forecasts of cyclones and generate useful early warnings in a particular region, data from all the countries in that region need to be brought together and fed into the weather models. Additionally, weather data from exclusive economic zones is currently unavailable, creating another data gap",
