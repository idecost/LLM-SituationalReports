This has led to a severe famine, to the point where a significant portion of the people in the north have been forced to eat tree leaves and bake ground-up animal feed instead of flour.Twenty-four-year-old farmer Yousef Saqr Abu Rabie of Beit Lahia told Euro-Med Monitor about the significant losses he incurred on Monday and Tuesday, 23-24 September, as a result of the bulldozing of dozens of dunams north of the town.",

The lack of proper burial facilities for the high number of casualties has led to unconventional and often unsanitary disposal of human remains.

While the population of Gaza is fully aware of and accustomed to the hygiene practices necessary for their health, they unfortunately no longer have access to them.Unsurprisingly, all these war impacts are creating the conditions for the resurgence of waterborne diseases. Without access to soap, water, or toilets, and in such crowded conditions, the risk of epidemics is skyrocketing.",

People have been repeatedly displaced and forced into smaller and smaller areas under bombardments and increasingly inhumane conditions.For a year, Israel, Hamas, and their respective allies have catastrophically failed to reach a deal on a sustained ceasefire in Gaza, while the risk of a full-blown regional conflict is now increasing.

However, the implementation of planned interventions cannot happen in the absence of unimpeded entry of required humanitarian items into Gaza, the availability of adequate quantities of fuel and facilitation of safe humanitarian movement between warehouses and distribution points.

Delays will cause the Strip to deteriorate further, cost more civilian lives, and heavily affect people's health outcomes.The international community must act swiftly and forcefully to end to Israel's crime of genocide in the Gaza Strip, which involves both the direct killing of, and the imposition of unbearable living conditions on, the Palestinian people there.",
