            "\"We are engaging with all involved on the resumption of the entry of goods, including fuel, and so that we can again begin managing incoming supplies,\" said the UN aid coordination office, OCHA late Wednesday. \"However, the situation remains extremely fluid and we continue to confront a range of challenges, amid active hostilities. We count on cooperation and facilitation to get these crossings operational again since stocks of critical supplies, including fuel, are being depleted by the hour. \"Tweet URL WFPMENAKerem Shalom crossing had been closed following a deadly rocket attack claimed by Hamas last weekend.",

And in case we lose accessibility, then we will be able to refer pregnant mothers, for instance, to field hospitals in Al Mawasi area as well as the Nasser Medical Complex,\" he said. Fuel running outMeanwhile, fuel critical for humanitarian operations in Gaza could run out \"tomorrow\" and some food stocks might only last to the end of the week, a senior UN aid official in the region said on Tuesday. Andrea de Domenico, head of the UN humanitarian affairs office, OCHA, in the occupied Palestinian territories, said the closure of the Rafah crossing with Egypt has severed access to fuel, affecting the entry of critical relief items and curtailing the movement of aid workers.",
            "\"We think as the UN that people should choose where they want to go and we will provide aid to them wherever they decide to seek shelter with their families,\" he said.When asked about the expanded humanitarian area that Israel has designated in the coastal town of Al-Mawasi for displaced Gazans to flee to, Anderson said the area \"certainly does not have the infrastructure that you would expect,\" adding that there are already over 400,000 people seeking shelter there. \"It's essentially a sandy area, so there's no sewage infrastructure, there's no water infrastructure. There aren't roads that lead into it. \"Anderson also said that people fleeing to Khan Younis would reach an area already devastated by the war.",
            "\"Yet the experience of the past seven months shows Palestinians who remain in Rafah will continue to be at risk of death and injury, whether by indiscriminate bombing, unlawful killing, or loss of access to food, water and healthcare,\" said Trk. \"This must not be allowed to happen. \"Those that elect to flout international humanitarian law and international human rights law must be held to account.",

We are reviewing that response now and discussing it with our partners in the region,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.",

            "Despite Israel's assurances that Al Mawasi is a safe zone to which citizens can evacuate, it is not safe at all because no where in Gaza is. If displaced people avoid attacks in Al Mawasi many are still subject to impending famine, lack of shelter, spread of disease, and scarce healthcare availability.The designated evacuation site of Al Mawasi is a sandy area which is unsuitable for hosting large numbers of displaced people. Since last Sunday no aid has come into Gaza by land. Israel has sealed the Rafah border crossing which is a key entry point for delivery of humanitarian supplies and aid agencies are almost out of food and fuel in Gaza.",
            "Gaza has no future. \"Guterres concernIn a bid to secure an end to the war and the release of all remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza, UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres issued a direct appeal to the Government of Israel late Tuesday \"to stop any escalation and engage constructively in the ongoing diplomatic talks\".Posting on X late on Tuesday, the UN chief said that he was \"disturbed and distressed\" by the Israeli Defense Forces' renewed military activity in Rafah, just as he called on Hamas leaders and Israel \"to show political courage\" and secure a ceasefire. \"After more than 1,100 Israelis killed in the Hamas terror attacks of 7 October, after more than 34,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, haven't we seen enough?\"",
            "I am also very worried about the safety of humanitarian workers in the affected areas.I reiterate. A full-scale offensive on Rafah cannot take place!All states with influence must do everything in their power to prevent it  to protect civilian lives.I call on Israel and Palestinian armed groups urgently to agree to a ceasefire, and all hostages must be released at once.",

Safe, lasting access needs to be sustained over time\".West Bank violence unabatedAs war continues in Gaza, the UN rights office, OHCHR, warned that violations against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have also increased substantially. \"The Israel Defence Forces IDF is acting as if there is an armed conflict in the West Bank,\" said Ajith Sunghay, head of the OHCHR office in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in an interview with UN News.Mr.",

Patients and healthcare workers forced to leave must be urgently protected.The international community knows that this invasion will be a catastrophe. The killing of civilians will accelerate and much more of Gaza's remaining infrastructure will be destroyed. The meagre humanitarian aid reaching people will be severely disrupted, just days after the head of the World Food Programme assessed that northern Gaza is experiencing \"full blown famine\" that is \"moving its way south\".The UK and other governments allied with Israel must work urgently to stop this assault from going ahead, avert a further humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and attain a permanent ceasefire.",
            "So where should they go now?There is no safe place in Gaza!These exhausted, famished people, many of whom have been displaced many times already, have no good options. Other towns across Gaza, including Khan Younis, which is supposed to receive those who are being displaced from Rafah right now, have already been reduced to rubble, and remain under attack. These are not safe places.I have repeatedly expressed my alarm about the catastrophic impact of a possible full-scale offensive on Rafah, including the possibility of further atrocity crimes. I can see no way that the latest evacuation orders, much less a full assault, in an area with an extremely dense presence of civilians, can be reconciled with the binding requirements of international humanitarian law and with the two sets of binding provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice.At this desperate moment, exacerbated by acts impeding the entry of humanitarian aid in Gaza through the three crossings, there is a dire shortage of fuel, which is hindering everything  from the movement to distribution of food, operation of hospitals and emergency services, sewage treatment and telecommunications.",
            "Speaking from Jerusalem, Mr. de Domenico said lack of fuel is a particular concern as humanitarians have just around 30,000 litres of diesel available when they normally use 200,000 litres a day. Priority is being given to health, water and communication, with some fuel set aside as contingency for the secure movement of staff. \"That will leave us basically with no fuel as of tomorrow,\" he said.",
            "There are children, women, elderly people and people with disabilities trying to flee in wheelchairs. Bakeries have stopped working because they don't have fuel, so we don't have bread. We don't have any water supply as that also depends on fuel deliveries, so yesterday we had to pay 50 just to refill our tank. Cars have stopped, so people coming from Rafah to the Middle Area are either walking or packed into vans carrying hundreds of people.Many people in Gaza are already suffering from famine, but now we are entering a new period of unprecedented hardship.",
            "This morning, Israeli tanks entered the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, blocking completely the passage for people and humanitarian aid.There are no safe spaces in Gaza. Israel has repeatedly attacked so-called safe zones', killing displaced people. Any claims from Israel that civilians can be safely relocated have no credibility.The failure of our leaders to back words with meaningful action is glaring.",

He stopped short of an explicit warning, however.This follows US President Joe Biden suggesting some US deliveries could be put on hold, as one shipment was last week, if such an attack materializes.
