The activity involves two interlinked exercises: the Flow Monitoring Counting FMC, a headcount of individuals crossing the border, and the Flow Monitoring Surveys FMS, which collect data on the profiles and intentions of randomly selected Afghan nationals. DTM FM is operational at four main crossing points connected to Afghanistan's National Highway as well as seven other crossing points with Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan.

Several villages were set ablaze and thousands of people had to leave the region and seek shelter in other parts of the country.Kurram, which was at the time part of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas FATA, was cut off from the rest of the country.
