      "\"None of the agencies had issued a red alert for Wayanad ahead of the July 30 landslides,\" it said.If disasters like this are to be avoided, experts said, urgent mitigation measures need to be implemented. \"Kerala has not been witnessing typical monsoon rains and has been struggling to achieve its average rainfall,\" said Mahesh Palawat, vice president of meteorology and climate change at Skymet Weather. \"Despite these heavy showers, it is yet to surpass its average rainfall so far. The rise in air and ocean temperatures has led to a drastic increase in moisture, making the atmosphere unstable.",

The disaster also left behind a trail of destruction in its wake by flattening hundreds of houses and destroying roads and bridges.Images from the site of disaster show gashes in the green hillside where mud slid down, as rescue workers trekked knee-deep in the muck to find missing people.

      "\"Such infrastructure projects, carried out without considering the region's geological sensitivity, can exacerbate the risk of landslides. \"Kerala has witnessed a construction boom in the last few decades, driven by rapid urbanisation and a growing population, that has often ignored ecological considerations. Buildings have been erected in areas prone to floods and landslides, with insufficient regard for safety regulations. The result is a landscape where natural disasters can have disproportionately severe consequences.One of the most vital components of disaster management is the implementation of effective early warning systems.",
      "\"The disaster in Wayanad revealed shortcomings in the state's ability to communicate risks and coordinate evacuation. In some cases, people were unaware of imminent danger or reluctant to leave because of the lack of clear and timely information.In any case, the response to the disaster has got mired in politicking. India's home minister Amit Shah said in the parliament that the Kerala government did not gauge the severity of the situation accurately despite the federal government despatching nine National Disaster Response Force teams to the state on 23 July. \"Had those blaming the government read the warnings, the situation would have been different,\" he declared.The Kerala government denied they were warned.",
      "\"There are still people who are trapped under the ground and those who have been swept away,\" Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters. \"The rescue operation will continue with all possible strength and means. \"More than 3,000 people had been moved out of the area and accommodated in 45 relief camps in the district, he said, adding that hundreds of personnel, including army soldiers, using drones and sniffer dogs were searching for survivors.Vijayan, a survivor who gave only one name, said he woke up in the middle of the night to feel the ground shake and see electric poles fall. \"A couple of neighbours and I ran to nearby houses where we heard cries for help and took some of the injured to safety,\" he told Asianet.",
      "\"This instability underscores the need for a comprehensive strategy involving both mitigation and adaptation measures. \"Several measures can be taken to mitigate the impact of landslides and excessive rains linked to climate change,\" Mr Palawat said. \"Implementing robust early warning systems through enhanced weather forecasting technologies can provide timely alerts, enabling residents to evacuate and prepare.\"",
      "\"This is one of the worst natural calamities that our state has seen. \"Our country has witnessed an alarming rise in landslides in recent years,\" he said. \"The need of the hour is a comprehensive action plan to address the growing frequency of natural calamities. \"The number of extremely heavy rainfall days have increased,\" Kartiki Negi of Indian environment think tank Climate Trends told AFP.",
