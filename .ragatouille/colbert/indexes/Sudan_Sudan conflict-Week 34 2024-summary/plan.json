Humanitarian workers and volunteers also face threats ranging from arrests and prolonged investigations to restrictions on movement, systematic targeting, and confiscation of the desperately needed aid they bring to assist citizens impacted by the war.The numerous restrictions imposed on civil society organisations and grassroots committees serving local communities have severely hampered their ability to gather information, assess the situation, and issue calls for assistance. Communication blackouts have further compounded these challenges by limiting communication capabilities and hindering access to funding via banking applications, which have become the sole means of transferring money.The local and foreign media face a similar predicament, unable to adequately report on the humanitarian crisis affecting refugees and displaced people due to restrictions, communication disruptions, and internet outages. Journalists are not permitted to operate freely in covering these critical issues, often forced to work in secrecy, which is entirely incompatible with the nature of their work.",

The first trucks carried food for about 13,000 people in West Darfur, but WFP has supplies for about 500,000 people ready to enter through the crossing. \"We urgently need to reach every corner of Sudan with food assistance - and this requires humanitarian corridors and all border crossings to be open so aid agencies can bring in supplies every single day,\" WFP Director Cindy McCain said in a statement. \"This is the only way to avoid widespread starvation.",
            "title: Sudan: aid trucks trickle into Darfur as army pauses delivery ban  content: A fraction of available aid has passed through the Adre border crossing from Chad into Sudan's hunger-ravaged Darfur region this week following a move by the Sudanese army to lift a ban on deliveries temporarily, Reuters has reported.The army's rival in Sudan's devastating 16-month-old civil war, the Rapid Support Forces militia, controls most of Darfur and the Adre crossing, the quickest way into the region. However, added the WFP, it had food for 500,000 people ready to move. More than six million Sudanese face food insecurity across Darfur, with more than 25 million, or about half the population, in a similar situation across the country.It was unclear if the food had reached Kreinik by Thursday. The RSF, which has looted aid trucks and warehouses on numerous occasions according to aid agencies, welcomed the deliveries in a statement late on Wednesday.A document by the army-aligned Humanitarian Aid Commission showed that the procedures set by the government included the presence of Sudanese authorities and soldiers at Chadian warehouses and the border for inspections.READ: 500 days of war in Sudan: Why has the world forgotten its largest humanitarian crisis?",
