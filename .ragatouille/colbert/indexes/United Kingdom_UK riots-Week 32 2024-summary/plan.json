The willingness, indeed eagerness, of some media to vilify and demonize certain communities and groups has also made this possible. When the government conducts a postmortem of the riots, it should not ignore the role politicians and media played in stoking fear, mistrust, and hostility towards these groups.The new Labour government inherits a country divided, in which the far right is a real and present danger.

That creates an even more challenging context for the Prevent programme whose objective is to prevent the radicalisation of individuals into far-right, Islamist and other forms of extremism. Social media companies should be doing more to reduce the spread of harmful misinformation; the Online Safety Act is yet to be fully implemented and should help, but it is complex to design levers that work effectively without compromising lawful free expression online.In light of evidence that most of the 2011 riots occurred in areas ranking in the bottom 10 on measures of social cohesion, the government needs to develop a proper social cohesion strategy.

These actions were a challenge to Britain's peaceful multi-ethnic identity.As Dame Sara Khan, the independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience under Rishi Sunak, told this newspaper, that did not come about in a political vacuum.

Wanting to tackle dangerous Channel crossings is not \"far right\", nor is wanting an immigration policy which finds the right balance between compassion and control, nor is supporting Brexit. We shouldn't pretend that far-right thugs need excuses in the form of Home Office policy to perpetrate their acts of violence.Instead, what needs to happen now begins with restoring law and order. Instead, we need to have a more serious approach to integration, social cohesion, and counterextremism.For too long we have neglected these issues, with cohesion policy reduced to hoping everyone will be nice to each other.",

Isn't it time we had judicial processes that would allow for the removal of particular material and the proportionate blocking of certain users?Similar questions arise at the sharp end of law enforcement around the use of facial recognition. In recent years, this technology has been used on our streets without any significant public debate or any parliamentary authorisation. We wouldn't dream of allowing telephone taps, DNA retention or even stop and search and arrest powers to be so unregulated by the law, yet this is precisely what has happened with facial recognition, thanks to a Conservative government that was casual with both the law and the doling out of public money to private contractors.Our facial images are gathered en masse via CCTV cameras, the passport database and the internet.",
            "It also leaves Labour with a task that goes far beyond the rapid administering of criminal justice in the courts.As Ms Khan argues, ineffective legislation permits pernicious racist narratives to be freely propagated, particularly on social media. This lacuna in our extremism laws must finally be addressed. Just as importantly, the mainstreaming and normalisation of far-right discourse on immigration in Britain, as elsewhere in Europe, is a political fact that requires a response. The reality of Britain as a multicultural society needs to be defended and celebrated, both rhetorically and through the provision of real resources and support to challenged areas.As has been said many times in the aftermath of Southport, the overwhelming majority of Britons will view the events of the past few days with utter revulsion.",

The action began as public anti-racist protests in response to the fatal shooting of 29-year-old Mark Duggan, but certain groups then mobilised over the following days to become violent and disorderly.The most severe disorder took place in London, as rioters clashed with police, destroyed vehicles, and looted shops. Incidents continued from August 6 to 11, with news footage showing police struggling to combat the growing violence.In the aftermath, many critics said police did not act quickly or effectively enough to curb the violence.",
            "Now is the time to come together, to support our neighbours and community, to safeguard and protect each other, especially those most vulnerable. \"Elsewhere, British singer-songwriter Nadine Shah, who is a Muslim, described scenes of violent riots on the streets of her hometown of Sunderland as \"rancid\". \"The scenes from Sunderland last night are rancid,\" she wrote. \"Love and solidarity to all my brothers and sisters feeling scared and targeted right now.",
            "Public opinion was split on whether the police used enough force, but human rights' charity Liberty said at the time that it was \"proportionate. \"More than 3,000 people were arrested during the disorder, and 186 police officers injured. The Criminal Prosecution Service CPS, led at the time by Sir Keir, responded severely.Emergency legislation was introduced to open courts for 24-hours, as thousands of people were processed. Sentences were 25 percent higher than usual on average, with experts saying it seemed the government was seeking to make an example of would-be rioters.In another unprecedented move, bail was denied for all of those awaiting trial.",
            "Race riots of the sort Britain experienced in 1919, 1948 and 1958 have always had the same motivations  racism and nativism.As brave reportage gave way to fumbling analysis, one fundamental reality was repeatedly overlooked. While there were horrific attacks on hotels housing asylum seekers, most of those targeted by the rioters were British citizens: members of communities with histories that go back three generations or more. When the mobs in Rotherham launched their sickening assault on a hotel, the racial slur spray-painted on to that hotel's walls was the P-word, aimed not at asylum seekers but squarely at the established British Muslim community.Riots are not protests and there is a difference between motivations and excuses. Despite much that has been said, the riots of 2024 were not born of \"legitimate grievances\" about poverty, underinvestment and the breakdown of basic services, all supposedly deepened by mass immigration.",
            "Remarkably, things escalated further as the weekend began, with far-right \"demonstrations\" descending into racist attacks, rioting and looting in Liverpool, Hull, Manchester and Stoke-on-Trent on Saturday. Some initially misattributed the disturbances to the English Defence League EDL  an outfit that ceased operating years ago  but this wave of demonstrations reflects the increasingly decentralised nature of the current far right. While activists affiliated with traditional far-right organisations have been involved, most of these protests were planned organically, often by local people, who are plugged into decentralised far-right networks online.The shared slogans, language and iconography don't show that these rioters form a cohesive or coordinated group; rather, it means that their organisers and attenders are often active in overlapping online spaces. Though not centrally organised, the participants are drawing from a common wellspring of anger and often recycle the same slogans  in particular \"enough is enough\", \"stop the boats\" and \"save our children\".Modern technology, and social media in particular, enables individuals to collaborate towards common political goals independent of traditional organisational structures.",
            "Reports have emerged of violent counterattacks in some areas.The head of London's Metropolitan Police Service said earlier Wednesday that officers were focused on protecting immigration lawyers and services. In addition to thousands of officers already deployed, about 1,300 specialist forces were on standby in case of serious trouble in London. \"We'll protect those people,\" Commissioner Mark Rowley said. \"It is completely unacceptable, regardless of your political views, to intimidate any sector of lawful activity, and we will not let the immigration asylum system be intimidated.",
            "Riot, damage and assault are serious offences, carrying heavy maximum sentences. This may have an immediate deterrent effect. Once defendants who wore scarves or balaclavas in the 2024 riots realise that the online instruction to \"mask up\" can be taken by courts as an aggravating factor in sentencing under public order laws, others may grasp how much they are risking. If the government exempted all riot-related convictions from the plan to reduce prison terms to 40 of sentence served from September, Starmer would strengthen the point further.But being strong in the aftermath of riots is not sufficient.",
            "Such wishy-washy notions of social cohesion have done nothing to build the sort of resilient multi-ethnic society most Britons want to see. Doing so means a properly funded three-tier approach.That approach firstly needs to root out extremism  whether on the far right or elsewhere  and tackle freedom-restricting harassment. It isn't  but having handed them the justice they deserve, our focus then needs to turn more seriously to the task of building the more resilient, cohesive society that we overwhelmingly want to live in.Luke Tryl is UK director of the More in Common think tank",
            "That's the primary test of any government. \"I will keep you safe,\" Keir Starmer promised early in the day, and indeed the \"full force of the law\" and a \"standing army\" of 6,000 police did just that, aided by the crowds of citizens praised today by police chiefs. Met police commissioner Mark Rowley cited \"the show of unity from communities\" that \"together defeated the challenges we have seen''. Let that message go far and wide.Slapping instant sentences on the violent, their faces and names plastered on screens while warning that hundreds more would follow them into jail, helped to do what the state must do, beyond all other duties: safeguard its people.",
            "The answer, I was told, was that the hotel is \"full of nonces\". Right.There were little kids in that hotel. So much for protecting the children, eh?My sense was that the riot felt more like a hooligans' ps-up rather than any form of protest. The atmosphere was febrile and the hatred tangible.I've read reports that the riots are an expression of legitimate anger about social injustice.",
            "The disturbances began after misinformation spread about the stabbing rampage that killed three girls in the seaside community of Southport, with social media users falsely identifying the suspect as an immigrant and a Muslim.Rioters spouting anti-immigrant slogans have attacked mosques and hotels housing asylum-seekers, creating fear in Muslim and immigrant communities. Some held signs saying \"Stop the far right,\" \"Migration is not a crime\" and \"Finchley against Fascism. \"Outside an immigration center in the Walthamstow area in east London, a counter-protest leader barked \"fascists gone\" to which a crowd of hundreds responded: \"off our streets. \"Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described the previous disturbances as \"far-right thuggery,\" rejecting any suggestion that the riots are about the government's immigration policies.",
            "The former is about supporting \"diverse yet established citizens and communities to live well together and be resilient to inevitable tensions that will occur from time to time\"; that includes intra-minority and intra-faith tension. The latter is about helping new arrivals to integrate into British life.Too much commentary in recent days has loosely attributed the riots to poor levels of integration; in fact, the UK performs relatively well on certain measures of integration, with sustained intergenerational falls in levels of prejudice, gradual decreases in levels of residential segregation, and second-generation immigrant children outperforming non-immigrant children at school. Despite several reports on community cohesion since 2000, the government does not have a framework with which to measure it nor an evidence base on what works. There are examples of incidents flaring up and being dealt with very poorly by local authorities; for example, the appalling treatment of the teacher in Batley, West Yorkshire, forced to go into hiding after he taught a lesson on free speech and blasphemy that included images of the prophet Muhammad.Finally, community cohesion is inevitably undermined by economic hardship.",
            "The idea that Britain enjoyed a seamlessly peaceful path towards the blessings of parliamentary democracy, tolerance and the rule of law is simply untrue. There was never a riot-free golden age. But each generation is surprised anew.Years ago, researching a book on the 1981 Brixton and Toxteth riots, the length of some of these arcs struck me forcefully. In that summer, London, Liverpool and other cities were battered by riots that did 216m worth of damage at 2024 prices, and led to more than 3,000 arrests, many of black people.",

On Monday, four men linked to disorder on Saturday appeared at Belfast magistrates court, while a 15-year-old boy appeared before the same court on Wednesday charged with rioting.

Nor should companies be given yet more unaccountable contracts for intrusive technology that replaces legal code with opaque computer code. Total societal surveillance is a dangerous and poor substitute for intelligence-led community cooperation and policing. VIP lanes and cosy chats with billionaires at Bletchley Park must be replaced by parliamentary process and primary legislation.",
            "The prompt arrest of so many rioters in preceding days, with some already sentenced to long spells in prison, undoubtedly had a deterrent effect. But on Thursday and Friday nights, anti-immigration unrest continued in Belfast and the police remain on alert this weekend.What we have seen so far remains on a much smaller scale than the England riots of 2011. But effort must now be devoted to understanding what drove this far-right hijacking of the killing of three young girls, propelled by misinformation about the identity of their attacker. Just 7 of the British public say they support the 2024 riots, but the targeting of mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers has revealed the extent of latent prejudice, including virulent Islamophobia, among a small minority of the population, and heightened fears among minority communities.",
            "There have been hundreds of arrests, and already dozens of rioters have been charged and sent to begin hefty prison terms, ranging from several months to nearly three years. Their ages, so far, span from 16 to 69. But there are wider inequalities that gave rise to the unrest which will take years to resolve.Riots took hold disproportionately in cities and towns suffering from high levels of deprivation; places where, over recent years, people have increasingly seen the creaking foundations of the British state through a lens that focuses unforgivingly on migration. \"You can't get a doctor's appointment, a dentist appointment, a hospital appointment,\" Paul James McDermott, 69, told CNN at a small far-right demonstration in Sheffield on Wednesday.",

Hundreds have been arrested.The riots broke out last week after far-right groups claimed on social media that the person charged with carrying out a horrific stabbing attack that left three children dead was a Muslim asylum seeker. \"The false name attributed to the attacker was circulated organically but also recommended to users by platform algorithms,\" the ISD said in a statement. \"Platforms therefore amplified misinformation to users who may not otherwise have been exposed, even after the police had confirmed the name was false.",

One Muslim man, Muj, who had been called over from Bradford to help his frightened friend who was stuck at the scene, said he was called a racial slur. Chants of \"Tommy Robinson\" and, to the disdain of other local people, \"Yorkshire\" could be heard from people who said they \"want our country back\".
