      "title: Afghanistan Durable Solution Repository  content: INTRODUCTIONAmid an influx of cross-border returnees from neighbouring Pakistan and Iran, Afghanistan is at risk of facing a protracted displacement crisis.The humanitarian response in Afghanistan acknowledges the challenges faced by pre-existing settlements, including reduced livelihood opportunities, increased demand for rentals, and strain on health and education facilities. Further, REACH's annual Whole of Afghanistan Assessment WoAA and ongoing Humanitarian Situation Monitoring HSM aim to capture household level, multi-sectoral needs across the country.This repository gathers and contextualises IMPACT's outputs through its various assessments related to durable solutions.",
      "title: Skyrocketing power bills draw protests near Pakistan's capital  content: Skyrocketing power bills draw protests near Pakistan's capitalProtests over skyrocketing power bills shut down a major road into Pakistan's capital on Monday as some 3,000 supporters of a major Islamist party continued a sit-in despite pouring monsoon rains.In Pakistan's southwest, meanwhile, thousands protested against police violence, an internet shutdown and highway closures. Officials say the increases were needed to meet conditions set by the International Monetary Fund for a 7 billion loan deal made earlier this month.The government has also added a confusing bevy of taxes on top of the base price, adding up to a bill that has more than doubled for some Pakistanis. \"This month I paid 22,000 rupees 80 for my electricity bill, while in May I only paid 10,000 rupees 36,\" said Asma Humayon, who teaches at a private school in the city of Lahore. \"I don't know how to run the kitchen; now half of my salary is going to energy bill.",
      "\"Hundreds of supporters of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party, mainly women, also rallied against rising bills in Lahore.Pakistani economist Ashfaque Hasan said another factor in costly power is a deal the government made in the 1990s to buy power from private companies at high prices. Authorities have not confirmed the casualty figures or the use of force.It's the latest unrest to strike the country's largest and poorest province. \"You people have created an apocalypse in Baluchistan for the last two days, injured many people, martyred a youth and forcibly disappeared hundreds,\" the committee said.A spokesperson for the Baluchistan government, Shahid Rind, said the provincial minister was heading to the city of Gwadar to try to contact the committee's leaders.",
      "Some of the women who spoke to The Guardian claimed that soldiers are also demanding sex in exchange for access to abandoned houses where it is still possible to loot items to sell in local markets.SAF denialBrig Gen Nabil Abdullah, the official spokesperson for the SAF, issued a stern statement shortly after publication of the article, condemning it as \"completely lacking in transparency and impartiality, and a desperate attempt to tarnish the reputation of the Sudanese Armed Forces, which the Sudanese people have always known as loyal to their citizens and protectors of their honour, land, and dignity. \"Gen Abdullah added that the report \"contained blatant falsehoods and lies against members of the armed forces in Omdurman\", and complained that \"the newspaper's correspondent completely avoided contacting any members of the armed forces,\" adding that \"the correspondent did not request an official permit from the authorities to work in the area. \"In response to questions from Radio Dabanga after the article was removed from the website, a Guardian spokesperson said: \"This article was taken down pending further information. It has been republished and we stand by the story.",
      "\"All the soup kitchens takaya in Arabic in old Omdurman have stopped working, Sheikh El Amin Omar, leader of the Sudanese El Gadiriya El Mukashfi Sufi order told Radio Dabanga. The area of old Omdurman, regained by the Sudanese Armed Forces SAF from the Rapid Support Forces RSF in February, is not very secure. \"He who does not die by the fire of weapons, dies of famine\", Sheikh Omar said.Gender-based violenceGender-based violence and exploitation is indeed widespread, perpetrated by combatants from both sides. As highlighted previously by Radio Dabanga, a report by the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa SIHA Network examines and underscores the dire circumstances faced by Sudanese women amid the ongoing crisis, calling conflict-related sexual violence CRSV \"the forgotten atrocities of the Sudan war.",
      "\"CRSV has been systematically employed by the RSF as an instrument of war since the Darfur conflict, continuing through other conflicts like the Khartoum Sit-In of 2019 and the recent invasion of El Gezira state in December 2023,\" the SIHA Network report says. \"Despite widespread documentation, CRSV remains underreported due to societal taboos and a lack of political will to address these crimes openly. This silence not only deepens the suffering of survivors but also perpetuates an environment where CRSV is normalised and used as a tactic of war. \"HRW: Khartoum is not Safe for Women!",
      "'In its latest report published yesterday, Human Rights Watch documents 262 cases of sexual violence by both sides in the war.The report entitled Khartoum is not Safe for Women! documents widespread sexual violence, as well as forced and child marriage during the conflict, in Khartoum and other cities.

      "title: Fatwa and Gwadar incident  content: THE situation in Pakistan is deeply troubling as the incompetence of politicians and civil administration has forced the army into handling sensitive ethnic, religious, cultural, and social conflicts, areas outside its training and primary purpose. The army is primarily trained to combat foreign enemies and assist the civilian government only when law and order are beyond civilian control. For example, during the Paris Olympics, over 10,000 military personnel provided security but returned to barracks after the event. In Pakistan, however, due to the persistent failures of political and civil leaders, the army is repeatedly called upon to manage conflicts that should be the civilian government's responsibility.During my over four decades of experience, I have frequently interacted with the Army Command when they were called to assist civilians.",
      "The army consistently argued that they should only be called upon in extreme circumstances. They emphasized that their military-grade weapons are unsuitable for use against their own citizens, which limits their effectiveness to that of the civilian government. While their presence and flag marches may initially intimidate the populace, this effect diminishes as people grow accustomed to the army's involvement in civilian matters.The involvement of the army in civilian affairs, driven by the incompetence of politicians and the civil administration, has severely damaged its image. Visible and virulent movements against the army have emerged in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa KP.",
      "The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement PTM in KP advocates for the rights of the Pashtun people, aiming to end extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and unlawful detentions, while demanding justice and human rights. In Balochistan, groups like the Baloch Liberation Army BLA, Baloch Republican Army BRA, Baloch Liberation Front BLF, and United Baloch Army UBA engage in armed struggle and propaganda against the army, further complicating the situation. This standoff has led to numerous incidents of violence, including the recent clash in Gwadar where a protest by the Balochistan Yakjehti Committee turned violent, resulting in the death of one soldier and injuries to 16 others. The loss of life, whether of a protester or a soldier, is deeply painful for every Pakistani patriot, underscoring the urgent need for competent governance and peaceful resolution of conflicts.Like violent movements that should have no place in a democratic country, another deeply worrying phenomenon reflecting a serious fault line in our national fabric is the issuance of fatwas calling for the death of anyone contradicting the fatwa giver's religious philosophy.",
      "There has been a history of such illegal fatwas in Pakistan. In 2012, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan issued a fatwa against Malala Yousafzai for advocating girls' education, leading to an assassination attempt. In 2011, a fatwa was issued against Salman Taseer for criticizing blasphemy laws, resulting in his assassination. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy faced fatwas in 2016 for her documentary on honour killings.",
      "Militant groups like TTP issued fatwas against polio vaccinations, claiming they were a Western conspiracy, leading to attacks on health workers. The 1974 fatwa against Ahmadis declared them non-Muslims, resulting in severe persecution. The Women's Protection Bill in 2006 faced fatwas for attempting to protect women from domestic violence. Javed Ahmad Ghamidi faced threats and was forced to leave Pakistan in 2005 due to his progressive views.",
      "Judges involved in the 2018 acquittal of Asia Bibi faced death fatwas from extremist groups, and those who delivered the 2019 Faizabad Dharna verdict were similarly targeted. The latest incident involves a fatwa against Supreme Court Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa.The Pakistan Army faces a two-pronged jeopardy, despite the unwavering dedication of its brave soldiers and officers who frequently embrace shahadat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to protect the country and its people from terrorists, criminals, and extremists. Instead of receiving the praise they rightly deserve, a virulent propaganda campaign has been unleashed against the army on social media and traditional media platforms. While this propaganda has failed to deter the armed forces from achieving their objectives, it negatively impacts overall morale.",
      "Therefore, it is imperative to address and reverse this situation promptly. In this context, the parliament should prioritize addressing the underlying fault lines within the country instead of wasting time on self-serving laws to protect itself from the judiciary or opposition parties. The parliament must investigate and understand the real reasons and factors that have transformed a large segment of society into separatist, insurgent, extremists, religious bigots, and intolerant individuals. These elements take pride in waging armed struggle against the army, burning religious symbols of minorities, lynching individuals accused of blasphemy, slaughtering those opposed to their religious views, and issuing fatwas to murder others without judicial process, all with impunity.Interestingly, the district administration, special branch, and other intelligence agencies monitor all gatherings as a standard operating procedure, compiling daily reports at the district, divisional, provincial, and national levels, which ultimately reach the Prime Minister's desk every morning.",
      "Ironically, neither the Prime Minister, the parliament, nor our so-called intellectual thinkers and philosophers have taken up the challenge to reverse the ever-increasing phenomena of separatism, extremism, bigotry, intolerance, and violent behavior. Due to this impunity, these elements have become emboldened to the point of issuing fatwas against high-ranking officials, including the army chief, the prime minister, judges, and now the chief justice.As a nation, we must insulate our army from civilian affairs. Politicians and civil administration should step forward boldly to handle all internal political conflicts, such as the PTM and Baloch insurgency, taking full responsibility for their success and failure. Moreover, civilian leadership must recognize that fatwas, especially those that incite violence or are criminal in nature, including those related to incitement to violence, hate speech, and terrorism, have no official legal status.",
      "\"The state was completely absent initially, leading to so much fighting. They did not interfere or send in forces or police despite the heavy presence of military and paramilitary personnel in the area,\" Jan claimed.Nisar Ahmad Khan, the district police officer, however, refutes the allegations of government inaction, saying that as soon as the fighting began, the state took swift action. He conceded, however, that a lack of manpower and the difficult terrain impeded the pace of the government's response. \"We have limited capacity, and Kurram is a large, difficult area to access due to its mountainous terrain.",
      "Often, we had to hike for hours to reach places where fighting was taking place. Plus, due to the porous border with Afghanistan, many people have access to sophisticated weapons, making it even more difficult,\" the police officer told Al Jazeera.However, he categorically denied any involvement of TTP or any other armed group targeting the Shia community for their religious identity. \"The Boshehra village, where most of the fighting took place, has a strategic advantage for defenders, and anyone who tried to gain access was easily targeted. In this case, it was the Maleekhel tribe, which suffered more losses,\" he said.Why do such clashes keep happening?Jan, the tribal elder, said even though a land dispute is at the heart of the current tensions, the region's long history of sectarian strife allows \"some elements\" from both sides to use religion as a tool to mobilise.",

      "Now, it stands as a bone of contention between ethnic Baloch, the federal government of Pakistan, and Beijing.In this impoverished, dusty coastal town, which serves as a hub for the much discussed China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, China has invested a considerable amount in infrastructure and development, bringing the town into the limelight. Still, the indigenous residents of Gwadar and ethnic Baloch complain that their resources are being plundered with little benefit to them.The Baloch have engaged in peaceful political activism against both Islamabad and China, while insurgents have also targeted Chinese interests with violent attacks. The ongoing unrest casts a shadow over the town's future and raises concerns about its stability and the viability of Chinese investment.In recent years, China has faced significant security challenges in Pakistan, with Baloch nationalist insurgents in Balochistan and Islamist militants in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa frequently attacking Chinese workers. The general public also appears increasingly unhappy with Chinese investment.",
      "Since 2021, Gwadar has seen multiple large-scale protests, with residents voicing grievances about being deprived of basic civic rights and necessities of life, despite the launch of CPEC almost a decade ago.Despite promises and grand claims that Gwadar would transform into a city akin to Shenzhen, Singapore, or Dubai, the reality remains starkly different. Today, Gwadar is still heavily dependent on neighboring Iran for electricity, while its nearly 100,000 residents rely on natural sources such as rain and traditional dams for water.In recent months, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee has emerged as a harsh critic of Chinese investment in Gwadar. The BYC is an influential and popular group in Balochistan, largely due to its peaceful struggle for Baloch rights. It vocally addresses human rights issues plaguing Balochistan, especially enforced disappearances, custodial killings, and the exploitation of Balochistan's resources.",
      "The BYC's agenda resonates deeply with the Baloch public, which is why the group has earned considerable trust in Balochistan in a remarkably short time.The BYC's main demand is an end to enforced disappearances in Balochistan, which the group's leadership rightly calls illegal and unconstitutional. The economic and social reforms undertaken in the early 1970s by Pakistan's former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto should have served as a roadmap for containing the current insurgency in Balochistan. Instead, Pakistani rulers have embarked on even more political adventures, including forcefully disappearing political activists, banning political parties, and cracking down on peaceful rights movements.In recent times, a popular peaceful rights movement in the form of the BYC has gained the trust and attention of not only the Baloch population  from Balochistan to Karachi and Dera Ghazi Khan in southern Punjab, where a huge population of Baloch lives  but also other political stakeholders in Balochistan, regardless of their stance on Pakistan's parliamentary politics. Both hardline nationalists who reject Pakistan's parliamentary politics and political parties in Balochistan deeply respect the BYC because of its considerable public support.",
      "However, the state's attitude toward the BYC seems hostile.BYC is highly regarded by the masses because it speaks about their genuine issues, particularly enforced disappearances that have plagued Balochistan for two decades. The failure of various governments to resolve these issues has deepened mistrust between the center and Baloch youth. This erosion of confidence in Baloch parliamentary parties has led the public to support alternate voices like the BYC, which has refrained from participating in elections or joining assemblies in Pakistan.Despite this, the BYC has been attempting to find solutions within the framework of the constitution of Pakistan. For this reason, the group organized a month-long sit-in in Islamabad from December to January, where they were also mistreated.",
      "The abuse of Baloch women and elders by Islamabad police conveyed a disappointing and negative message, and likely served as motivation for later violent attacks in Balochistan.Another reason the BYC has gained public trust, especially among young Baloch women, is its indirect fight against patriarchy and gender inequality, which are deeply rooted in Baloch society. For the first time, a peaceful rights movement is led by young women, who make up the majority of BYC supporters. These young women have challenged the cultural status quo and outdated traditions, as well as the power corridors in Pakistan. They have inspired ordinary Baloch by removing the fear that has long held them back.Movements like the BYC are rare in the region, particularly because women are at the forefront.",
      "Many of these young women are driven by personal victimization; for instance, BYC organizer Dr. Mahrang Baloch, a general surgeon, lost her father to enforced disappearance. Her personal experience and commitment to the cause resonate deeply with ordinary Baloch.Engaging leaders like Mahrang Baloch and having a political dialogue with the BYC represented a crucial opportunity for Pakistan's political and military leadership, which has long dreamed of talking to Baloch nationalists to find a solution to Balochistan's conundrum. However, due to a lack of political seriousness in Balochistan, this opportunity has been nearly missed.The provincial government of Balochistan likely missed this chance deliberately, as the current government representatives in Balochistan do not believe in political dialogue. Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti, a staunch supporter of the powerful military and Pakistan's former caretaker interior minister just before the elections, was brought into power through what many see as hijacked elections.",
      "This process was widely viewed as a violation of democratic principles and Pakistan's election rules. His and his administration's reliance on violence to address public grievances and maintain power has led some to describe them as artificial leaders, having used coercion rather than democratic processes to secure their positions.The state's harsh treatment of the BYC last week has only reinforced the narrative that peaceful activism has no place in Balochistan. This will ultimately benefit the Baloch separatist insurgents, who have long said that peaceful activism is futile in Pakistan. By using force against a peaceful movement with large public support, the Pakistani government risks driving more Baloch youth toward a violent insurgency.This will, over the years, create greater challenges not only for Islamabad in tackling Balochistan's two-decade-long insurgency and finding a solution to the province's issues but also for China in investing in Balochistan, especially in Gwadar."
