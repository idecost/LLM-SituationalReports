This comes after weeks of torrential rain, which caused severe structural damage to the dam. The floods have changed the lives of thousands and caused high levels of damage to infrastructures. The impacts of the recent floods compound with Nigeria's pre-existing humanitarian crisis, which includes armed conflict, widespread malnutrition, and a failing economy.Ali Ndume, a representative for Borno South, emphasizes the severity of the destruction, saying, \"Homes, institutions, government agencies, and other businesses have been submerged in the flood."

But as we witness these disasters unfold year after year, we must confront a pressing question: Are these floods simply a manifestation of climate change, or are they the result of government failure to develop adequate infrastructure to manage water flow?There is no denying that climate change plays a significant role in the increased frequency and severity of floods in Nigeria."

This dual challenge is a clear indication that Nigeria is on the front lines of the climate crisis.While climate change is a contributing factor, it cannot be the sole scapegoat for Nigeria's flooding woes. A significant part of the problem lies in the government's consistent failure to develop and maintain adequate infrastructure that can handle heavy rainfall and manage water flow. The lack of proper urban planning, inadequate drainage systems, and insufficient investment in flood control measures have left many communities vulnerable to flooding.Nigeria's major cities, such as Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Abuja, are plagued by poor drainage systems that quickly become overwhelmed during heavy rains."

Climate change-induced heavy rains would not cause as much devastation if there were proper infrastructure in place to manage water flow. Conversely, the impact of inadequate infrastructure is magnified by the increasing intensity of rainfall due to climate change.Nigeria's government must recognize that while they cannot control the climate, they have the power and responsibility to build resilient systems that can mitigate the effects of climate change. This involves investing in modern drainage systems, enforcing strict building codes, ensuring proper waste management, and engaging in comprehensive urban planning that considers the changing climate.Addressing Nigeria's flood problem requires a multi-faceted approach."

This involves creating early warning systems for floods, educating communities about the risks and responses to flooding, and investing in research to better understand the impacts of climate change on Nigeria's hydrology.International cooperation is also crucial.

A rapid impact assessment conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization's Food Security and Nutrition Information SystemRelief Web, using advanced geospatial techniques, highlighted the disaster's scale: showing that 210,084 people directly affected, 98,726 hectares of farmland damaged, and 279,400 sheep and goats impacted.These flash floods, which impacted several governorates, are likely to exacerbate the already widespread malnutrition issues in the country, with children and vulnerable communities being at the highest risk. The significant damage to Yemen's agricultural sector presents both immediate and long-term threats: with immediate impact: Reduced availability of food; and long-term consequences: Weakened food security and economic stabilityTo tackle this crisis, a two-pronged approach is essential to provide urgent food and non-food assistance to affected populations and develop strategies for long-term agricultural recovery and food security."

Between August and September 2024, hefty rains affected many LGAs in Borno State, resulting in significant flooding that has devastated various communities. Furthermore, on 9 September 2024, Maiduguri was affected by a massive flood due to the collapse of Alau dam in the neighbouring Konduga LGA of Borno State. The collapse of the dam, exacerbated the flooding in Maiduguri in addition to the continuous heavy rainfall."

The floods have caused extensive damage to infrastructure, crops, and shelters, severely affecting livelihoods and displacing many households. Climate variability and human-induced factors have exacerbated the flood recently, leading to increased displacement across Nigeria.Between 4 and 12 September 2024, the Displacement Tracking Matrix DTM, in collaboration with the National Emergency Management Agency NEMA, the Borno State Emergency Management Agency BOSEMA, and the Nigerian Red Cross Society NRCS, identified 138 locations in Borno State that were impacted by floods or received internally displaced persons IDPs due to the flooding. Through a network of key informants and field focal points, and in close coordination with other humanitarian partners and local authorities, DTM conducted assessments in these locations to provide insights to the humanitarian community on the affected population's primary needs, vulnerabilities, and mobility intentions.In the 19 local government areas LGAs of Borno State that were assessed, DTM identified 320,791 individuals in 65,731 households affected by the floods."

States that have recorded widespread damage to farmland include Bauchi, Taraba, Niger, Jigawa and Sokoto. The damage to crops risks elevating food insecurity in the ongoing lean season, and in the coming months. This may lead to a further deterioration in the already alarming food insecurity across the country."

This expansion posed significant challenges, as the newly affected states had limited experience in managing the disease and lacked the necessary resources and infrastructure for timely detection and response. In response to this evolving situation, the Red Cross scaled up its intervention efforts, targeting newly affected LGAs in the endemic states and the newly impacted states with high case fatalities.The Red Cross' intervention efforts have shown promising results, as reflected in the recent decline in the Lassa Fever epicurve over the past few weeks. The NCDC has acknowledged the Red Cross' contributions, with the latest epidemiological data indicating a reduction in the number of new Lassa Fever cases compared to the earlier stages of the outbreak.Through this DREF Operation, the NRCS has significantly contributed to several key areas:Strengthened Surveillance and Early Detection: Red Cross volunteers are collaborating closely with state and local authorities to enhance disease surveillance systems, enabling the rapid identification and reporting of suspected Lassa Fever cases in all targeted areas."

During the planning of this operation, a strategic decision was made to replace Cross River, an endemic state, with Rivers State as a target area. This shift was based on the observation that, while Cross River is indeed affected by Lassa Fever, Rivers State had a higher case fatality rate and lower awareness about the disease among the local population. By focusing on Rivers State, the operation was able to direct resources and interventions towards a non-endemic area experiencing a rise in reported cases, where community knowledge about the disease was limited."

The NCDC has also pointed out that this was the peak season for Lassa fever outbreak, but due to the tension and fear of transmission and consequential deaths of healthcare workers, the community health workers are rejecting to investigate, assess, and report cases of Lassa fever. Furthermore, there is also a historical delay between the data collected at the community level and the available published reports which could hide a bigger situation.Also, in some of the endemic states, cases of Lassa fever were recorded in LGAs that have never reported cases in the past years, with increased fatality being that they were novices to the diseases. Following the general gaps in RCCE and case finding, the NCDC requested the NS to fill the gaps in those areas."

Shortages of personal protective equipment PPE, inadequate training on infection prevention and control practices has compromised the safety of healthcare workers and contributed to nosocomial transmission.Additionally, coordination among various stakeholders involved in the outbreak response is quite suboptimal. This is due to the concurrent outbreaks of Diphtheria, Cerebrospinal Meningitis CSM, and Lassa fever, with more attention given to diphtheria and CSM, thereby hindering the implementation of a cohesive and effective response strategy to combat the outbreak.In many affected areas, there is lack of specialized psychosocial support services, including counselling, therapy, and support groups, leaving individuals and communities without access to needed mental health care. Most healthcare workers and responders also lack training in providing psychosocial support, including skills in active listening, empathy, and trauma-informed care.A need was identified for enhanced community engagement and active case search in response to the Lassa fever outbreak."

However, gaps in hygiene promotion efforts, including limited awareness and education about proper hygiene practices, has weakened the effectiveness of preventive measures. Poor food hygiene practices, such as improper storage, handling, and preparation of food, can also contribute to the transmission of Lassa fever and other foodborne illnesses. Multimammate rats are the primary reservoir of the Lassa virus therefore, dislodging them is crucial for preventing Lassa fever outbreak."
