Focusing on human capital development, the study demonstrates the multiple impacts of disaster risk reduction DRR policies on human capital investment, including the effect of schooling opportunities for households constrained by the subsistence consumption constraint.The analyses clarified that the impacts of DRR policies on human-capital-investment behavior include four effects: the income effect, the substitution effect, the choice-opportunity-provision effect, and the externality-reinforcement effect. Numerical simulations, performed for two economies modeled after Madagascar and Fiji, imply that different effects dominate in each of the two economies, resulting in qualitatively different configurations of the dynamic processes of growth and distribution."

Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh, with floods being the primary driver, recorded the highest number of disaster displacements in 2022. Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh, hosting about a million Rohingya refugees, faces escalating climate-related threats, impacting camp life, safety during irregular movement, and prospects for return to Myanmar. While initial displacement from Myanmar was driven by persecution and conflicts, the dire conditions in refugee camps are increasingly influenced by climate factors, potentially contributing to onward movements to neighbouring countries like India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.The emerging impact of climate change on the displacement and migration dynamics of Rohingya is increasingly relevant."

    "paragraph": "Climate change introduces additional layers of challenges to the already dire situation of the Rohingya, particularly in Bangladesh and neighbouring countries, where they seek refuge. Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar are vulnerable to extreme weather events, with urgent climate mitigation and disaster preparedness measures needed to mitigate risks such as cyclones and landslides. Displaced populations like the Rohingya are particularly susceptible to secondary displacement due to settling in hazard-prone areas, exacerbating the risk of climate-related movement on a larger scale. The combination of food insecurity, violence, lack of livelihoods, and dwindling hope for durable solutions has led to a surge in irregular maritime movement of Rohingya across the region in recent months.Though conflict remains the primary driver of Rohingya displacement, climate and environmental factors along with the deteriorating conditions in the camps significantly exacerbates migration risks, particularly during perilous sea journeys."

    "paragraph": "In 2023, a staggering 13 of Rohingya perished or went missing during such journeys.1 Within refugee camps, climate-induced hazards such as floods and cyclones pose additional threats, leading to internal displacement and necessitating proactive evacuation strategies. Moreover, involuntary immobility stemming from restricted mobility rights and lack of livelihood opportunities in Bangladesh compounds vulnerabilities, especially during climate-related disasters. The controversial relocation of Rohingya to Bhasan Char, touted as a safer alternative, faces scepticism due to inadequate infrastructure and emergency preparedness, raising concerns about their safety during disasters. Suspected coerced relocations and the possibility of climate-induced forced return further highlight the complexities of mobility decisions amid environmental risks."

For India and the United States to move from a deconflicted state to a more compatible one, the two states should consider mapping avenues where interoperability can be enhanced.Given Indian sensitivities, it would be politically most feasible for both partners to focus on operations against non-state actors."

India, the United States, and other countries regularly help littoral states with capacity building, and CT-151 and 153 within the CMF are mandated for the same.

In 2023, approximately 128 million people received lifesaving assistance. However, due to funding shortages, humanitarian organisations fell short of reaching their target, assisting less than two-thirds of the people they aimed to support.

The court can also issue an arrest warrant, relying on member countries to make the arrest and transfer the suspect to the ICC.If the suspect appears before the court, a pre-trial takes place in which the court decides if there is enough evidence for the case to go to trial. Then there is a trial before three ICC judges, in which the prosecution must prove \"beyond reasonable doubt\" that the individual is guilty of the crimes.Once a verdict passes, the charged individual may be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison."

    "paragraph": "Under exceptional circumstances, a life sentence can also be given, the court says.The ICC has so far issued arrest warrants against 42 people, 21 of whom have been detained with the help of member states. \"The immediate problem for Israeli officials under any ICC arrest warrant would be that the court's 124 member states would be under a legal obligation to arrest such officials if they traveled to any of those 124 countries,\" Chile Eboe-Osuji, a former ICC president, wrote this month in Foreign Policy magazine. \"That obligation should not be underestimated,\" he said, adding that \"just last year, Putin canceled his plans to attend the BRICS summit in South Africa, in the apparent light of Pretoria's obligation to arrest him. When a case is not within the ICC's jurisdiction, the UN Security Council can refer that case to the ICC, granting it jurisdiction.The court can investigate alleged crimes committed on the territory, or by a national, of any state that has accepted the court's jurisdiction by signing the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the ICC."

But that doesn't mean its citizens cannot be prosecuted by the court.The court had already been investigating possible crimes committed by Israel since 2014 in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem. The investigation began in March 2021, and was referred to the court by the Palestinian Authority, which adopted the ICC's mandate in 2015 as the State of Palestine. The ICC concluded then that it has jurisdiction on the conflict and, \"by majority, that the territorial scope of this jurisdiction extends to Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem."

    "paragraph": "title: Beyond renewables: A coordinated and just transition for Bangladesh  content: Bangladesh is lagging behind its renewable energy targets, with the current capacity standing at just four percent relative to the target of 10 percent by 2020, making it unlikely to reach the target of 100 percent by 2050. Yet, the success of the latest Conference of the Parties COP28 agreement to substantially increase renewables in the next decade relies heavily on Asia, where many countries like Bangladesh are struggling to keep up.Conversations and debates are plentiful around energy sources: renewables versus fossil fuel, and the challenges with renewables like high land requirements for solar expansion. However, what it takes for developing countries like Bangladesh to achieve a green transition gets limited attention.So what are the crucial aspects of successful renewable energy transition that must be considered for a country like Bangladesh?Transmission and distributionThe Bangladesh government has built many power plants in recent years, but without corresponding investments to enhance the efficiency and functionality of the transmission and distribution systems. Without simultaneous, stepwise improvements in transmission, we risk a capacity logjam by only increasing production capacity, be it in renewables or fossil fuel."

    "paragraph": "Regular planned power outages load-shedding while the existing power plants operate below capacity indicate an inadequate transmission system. However, another important cause of below-capacity production is the rising costs of importing coal, gas, and oil amid the growing foreign exchange reserve crisis. This further emphasises the need for diversifying domestic energy sources into renewables, especially because the country's existing gas reserve is dwindling and new exploration is not yet on the horizon.However, to accommodate the intermittency of renewablessuch as the seasonality of hydropower and surge during noon for solar powerthe transmission and distribution system must be updated. Moreover, our ambitious 2050 goal is only possible with trade within the region, which also requires expanding the transmission system."

Indeed, the recent tripartite power-sharing agreement between Bangladesh, Nepal, and India is a step in that direction. But ramping up regional trade may require dedicated transmission lines and grid integration. These technical challenges can be answered with tried and tested solutions elsewhere."

    "paragraph": "However, these require investment and coordinated development across the board, in line with capacity increases and demand mapping for the medium and long run as our industrial energy requirements are expected to continue changing.Such investments in the transmission and distribution system have the added benefit of increasing efficiency and thereby minimising system loss and the associated carbon emissions from power use. The upgrading of grid systems needs to support rooftop solar and net metering options for both households and industrial rooftops, including in economic zones. Lowering high duties on inverters and greater availability of bi-directional metres could incentivise the adoption of rooftop solar by allowing sell-back to the grid. But most importantly, the grid needs to be upgraded to support such an initiative.Sources and costs of financingInfrastructure projects in developing and emerging economies often cannot attract sufficient financing."

    "paragraph": "Challenges of scaling up investments include the high cost of funds in developing countries like Bangladesh, partly due to the lack of a deep domestic financing market. The constraint may be partially addressed by using a combination of sources at different stages of the projectpublic financing from governments and banks acting as debt investors in the early stage, and bond financing at a later stage.As we become a developing country, it would be beneficial to continue to have concessional rates for sectors like renewables and transmission. Multilateral development institutions are well-placed to provide long-term financing for projects that have public benefits. With the proliferation of Southern-led development banks like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank AIIB, New Development Bank NDB, and the Islamic Development Bank IsDB, in addition to the traditional Bretton Woods Institutions BWIs like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank ADB, different types of support for large infrastructure projects at different stages are possible.Older multilaterals and the newer Southern-led multilateral development banks are increasingly financing different kinds of projects."

Instead, large-scale power projects are now funded through bilateral financing and the newer Southern-led policy banks. This difference between older and newer multilaterals in their respective specialisations could help address challenges around inadequate preparation and due diligence of projects that countries like Bangladesh face when seeking financing, which contributes to the higher cost of financing. The prioritisation of older BWIs on capacity-building could help Bangladesh do the necessary leg work required to seek financing for bankable projects from Southern development banks and other bilateral sources.Solar expansion through agrivoltaics will involve more jobs for women and low-skill workers in Bangladesh than any other power source, fossil fuel or renewable."

The financing terms, including interest rates and repayment timelines, are often not made obvious to the taxpayers. Increasing production capacity without simultaneously improving transmission and distribution systems will mean unused power plants that are not operating, while loan repayments for their construction keep racking up. Finally, infrastructure financing in Bangladesh relies on policy support such as subsidies or feed-in tariffs for economic viability."

Furthermore, we need to consider not only the total number of jobs produced by renewable expansion, but also who gets the jobs. An ongoing study by BRAC Institute of Governance and Development BIGD estimates the direct and upstream impact of renewable transition in Bangladesh.Solar energy is the most feasible option for Bangladesh, but it is land-intensive and requires importing almost all the necessary inputs."

    "paragraph": "In the medium run, this means solar expansion in the country will not see gains from upstream employment as solar panel-producing countries do.Gas and coal plants require more construction and land preparation compared to solar, providing jobs for low and middle-skill workers. Our research shows solar expansion just on its own leads to a loss of jobs for low and middle-skill workers in Bangladesh. However, if solar energy is combined with agriculturecalled agrivoltaics or agrisolar energythe land intensity will be reduced. Moreover, solar expansion through agrivoltaics will involve more jobs for women and low-skill workers in Bangladesh than any other power source, fossil fuel or renewable.Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with immense pressure on agricultural land."

    "paragraph": "Agriculture remains the largest employment sector in the country, employing over 40 percent of the country's workforce. Although the agricultural share in the economy has been declining over the years, over 46 percent of all households in Bangladesh have derived some income from agriculture. Gains in agriculture accounted for 90 percent of the reduction in poverty between 2005 and 2010. A land policy draft by the government in 2016 discourages using agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes like industrial or infrastructural development."

    "paragraph": "Hence, land shortages in the nation continue to hold back renewable energy development.Harvesting crops and solar energy using agrivoltaics on one-crop land could be a promising solution for Bangladesh's land scarcity and agriculture production in the short and medium terms. In the longer term, Bangladesh could benefit by developing its abilities to first assemble and then produce solar panels and their components.Agrivoltaics can increase the economic value of the land by more than 30 percent and increase the overall land productivity by 60-70 percent. Crops that grow under partial shade, like tomato, cotton, potato, tea, coffee, garlic, onion and turmeric, are best suited for agrivoltaic systems. For instance, with only four hours of gentle sunlight each day and minimal irrigation, garlic and onions can be grown."

    "paragraph": "The added shade can further reduce irrigation requirements by minimising evapotranspiration rates. Moreover, the production of vegetable crops under the panel can reduce soil erosion and the amount of dust on the solar panel.Allocating agricultural lands to produce energy only could have an immense impact on the livelihood of agriculture-based households. Hence, simultaneous use of land for farming the right type of crops and generating solar energy can be a win-win solution, keeping in mind the marketability of the crop. The next steps involve a proof-of-concept pilot where variations in crop types and solar panel angles are considered."

While needs increased by 7 in 2023, major donors reduced their contribution by 41 leading to a funding shortfall of 64. Annex 1 summarizes the study design used in each pilot country.

    "paragraph": "WFP cuts impacted consumption significantly more for de-prioritized beneficiaries in Syria while all beneficiaries experienced a similar reduction in food consumption in Afghanistan. This includes further rationing their already low food consumption either by reducing meal diversity, frequency, quality or size. As a result, several beneficiaries interviewed said that inadequate food consumption and nutrition impacted their physical health, making them feel weak and unable to engage in daily work activities.FOOD SECURITY  LIVELIHOOD COPING STRATEGIESAs another coping strategy, evidence points to beneficiaries using unsustainable alternative funding sources to access food, increasingly relying on the borrowing of money or credit. For example, in Afghanistan, excluded households experienced a 300 rise in credit-based purchases of key food groups."

    "paragraph": "Beneficiaries decreased their spending on health and education to meet food needs after the cuts: as a result, children are withdrawn from schools and forced to work in often harsh conditions. Coping strategies used by women and children transform household dynamics, as families struggle to secure food, which can spark conflicts and present distinct parenting hurdles2. Begging increased after the cuts: in Afghanistan, this was especially severe in women-headed homes3. Meanwhile in Malawi, women increasingly engaged in transactional sex to earn money to buy food.Malawi: Female Participant in FGD Once WFP cash is over, I will sell my body for 2,000 KW to get food."

    "paragraph": "For instance, focus group discussions showed increased occurrences of theft and criminal behavior4. In Syria and Bangladesh, it was reported that young people, including children, move with the goal to financially support their families. Indeed, the increased reliance on unstainable coping strategies is a testament of how beneficiaries sacrifice long-term resilience for short-term survival.Needing immediate solutions to cope with this shock and secure food, most vulnerable family members, such as children and women, are required to endure. Children being removed from school attests to how this shock will have long-standing impact on families.In the few months after the cuts, households have relied on coping mechanisms and community support to sustain food consumption."

    "paragraph": "However, these informal safety nets might also be affected since social relations and level of criminal activities worsened in some countries after the cuts.The impact seen on food security, coping strategies used and the community all indicate a reduction in means available for households' resilience. As such, in the event of additional shocks, the imperative for humanitarian aid could increase to higher level than previously needed, driving the humanitarian community further away from addressing a Zero Hunger mandate.As noticed within the study, beneficiaries experiencing a reduction in assistance and not finding satisfying livelihood opportunities also consider moving away from their communities. This highlights the importance of monitoring the chain reaction from cuts over time, but also across borders. Beneficiaries embarking on arduous journeys abroad could substantially increase the cost for donors who must support those beneficiaries at their countries' borders.With alarmingly low funding forecasts, the need for WFP's assistance will continue to increase if additional cuts are implemented, as unsustainable coping strategies are used at the detriment of a household's ability to attain self-sufficiency."

Diphtheria: During the period under review, there were no confirmed cases or deaths from Diphtheria, maintaining a case-fatality ratio of less than 1. This achievement is likely due to the enhanced immunity across the population, resulting from the effective Diphtheria immunisation campaign in the latter part of 2023, which achieved a 95 vaccination rate. Moreover, prompt surveillance and the organised and collaborative case management efforts by WHO and health sector partners have been instrumental."

The bumper harvest following favourable short rains performance both locally and from neighbouring counties led to an increase in market volumes, thereby lowering prices. Traders also cited the decline inpump prices, even though still elevated Figure 9: Prices of maize; Kajiado County, April 2024 relative to the same period last year, and the recent appreciation of the Kenya shilling as driving factors to reduced prices."

    "paragraph": "Average livestock prices werehigher in pastoral areas. In all livelihood zones, livestock were in their usual wet season grazing areas with good health, which resulted in increased production and consumption. The increase in milk consumption was equally attributed to the flooding situation which has affected market access for alternative household food stuff. The variation was attributed to significant production in agro pastoral areas compared to pastoral areas which have also experience more floodingespecially in Magadi, Keekonyokia, Figure 12: Household milk consumption; Kajiado County, April 2024 Loodokilani, Lenkism, Amboseli, andEwuaso."
