    "paragraph": "title: Afghanistan Protection Analysis Update - Update on protracted-crisis and climate-related protection risks trends, May 2024  content: Afghanistan is undergoing a complex and multifaceted protection crisis after four decades of armed conflict and is still grappling with its long-term consequences, including high explosive ordnance contamination, and widespread destruction of essential infrastructure. An estimated 6.3 million Afghans are still currently displaced, with many who displaced multiple times. Marginalisation, discriminatory norms and practices continue to be widespread, including the curtailment of women and girls' rights and their participation in the economic, social, and public life since the Taliban led de facto authorities DfA takeover in August 2021.Following the consolidation of their control, there has been a crippling economic deterioration coupled by increasing climate-shocks such a third-consecutive year of drought and multiple earthquakes which resulted in wide-scale destruction of over 382 villages across Herat Province and directly affecting over 275'000 people in October 2023. Simultaneously, Afghanistan is also facing large-scale returns from Pakistan, including over 493'300 from 15 September 2023 to the end of December 2023."

Hence, despite a significant decrease in active conduct of hostilities across Afghanistan, widespread protection risks persist, characterized by significant protracted displacement, mine and explosive ordnance contamination, discrimination, and denial of access to services, resources and humanitarian assistance, restrictions to freedom of movement, growing threat of forced evictions, increased risks of gender-based violence GBV, child labour, early marriage and heightened needs for mental health and psychosocial support. The protection space is shrinking and is affecting particularly women, girls, IDPs, returnees, persons living with disabilities, elderly, and other vulnerable groups.

Floods at the weekend in the western province of Ghor and Faryab province in the north brought further devastation and killed at least 110 people, including children.Arshad Malik, Country Director of Save the Children Afghanistan, said:\"Extreme weather events pose a serious risk to all children in Afghanistan whose families or communities rely on farming to survive. This equates to nearly 13.2 million children or 70 of children in Afghanistan. Severe flooding and prolonged drought are increasing in frequency, and they are wiping out crops, killing livestock and drastically reducing vital food supplies and diminishing water sources.We are seeing the real time effect of the climate crisis here in Afghanistan and we can't delay action."

Women and girls took another step back as new edicts disenfranchised their freedom and denied them access to education and safe spaces outside their homes.The expulsion of Afghans from Pakistan has meant that more people in the country are now hungry, vulnerable, and ill-equipped to support themselves."

It is thus imperative to prioritize investment in communities and empower displaced and returnee populations to take ownership of their own protection. Embedding protection work within the communities, including among returnees, contributes to the sustainability of interventions and peaceful coexistence, a key factor facilitating their reintegration. Upon their return, returnees often grapple with limited resources, information and barriers to accessing basic needs and services, given that knowledge around this is primarily embedded within community-based structures.Economic hardship and limited livelihood opportunities stemming from the ongoing humanitarian crises are exacerbating protection risks for the affected populations."

Through protection monitoring, humanitarian stakeholders are observing increased numbers of affected families adopting negative coping mechanisms, which result in further exploitation of vulnerable groups, especially children. Increased pressure on the host communities not only compromises their ability to welcome Afghan returnees, but also exacerbates the overall protection environment in Afghanistan for displaced people, returnees and host communities alike. Women and girls, constrained by severe restrictions of movement and participation in education, employment or public life, face particular challenges in meeting their basic needs."

While multi-sectorial services are accessible at border points, such provisions are ad-hoc and are not as systematized in return areas. Therefore, establishing entry points for protection response, such as through protection information desks and integrated services with livelihoods, legal aid and health are essential to mitigate risks and deliver a comprehensive response to address the protection needs of returnees."

The food MEB value will be set in AFN value and applying the prevalent exchange rates. The transfer value will potentially be changed when there is:1.Trigger 1: A change in food basket cost in AFN 10 and 20 sustained for a period of eight consecutive weeks warrants a food basket cost revision. A tolerance of 2 percentage points or a price change of between 18 would also trigger a revision.Cash for work: Cash for work is commonly used in Afghanistan to cover food and income gap for the basic food basket and to rehabilitate basic livelihoods infrastructure."

    "paragraph": "This package is proposed for only vulnerable households on average 2 large ruminants and 8 small ruminants.Poultry package: Poultry plays an important role in improving daily food consumption and income for poor rural communities. FSAC designed the below package in consultation with NGO partners and government to improve food security and nutrition status, especially for women and children. The same package can be provided in cash where markets are functional and poultry packages are available in the local market. As multiple sectors have delivered small ruminant packages in the past, it is important to standardize this intervention and to ensure that inputs are delivered in a way to ensure sustainability.Due to funding limitations and to reach many beneficiaries FSAC can recommend 50 of the package."

WHO and Health Cluster partners have difficulties reaching affected populations due to severe damage to transportation infrastructure, including roads and bridges. As a result, communities are isolated, and movement between villages is hindered by flowing rivers. In addition, the blockade of the Herat to Ghor road is hindering the delivery of emergency supplies from Herat, exacerbating the challenges faced by relief efforts.Poverty and a lack of community awareness regarding communicable diseases are significant obstacles to effective response and recovery efforts."
