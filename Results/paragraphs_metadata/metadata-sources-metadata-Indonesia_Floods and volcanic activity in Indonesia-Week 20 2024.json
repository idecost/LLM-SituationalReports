It claimed 60 lives and left 19 missing. On the other hand, various businesses, such as cafes, were also established in dangerous places, such as on cliff edges and riverbanks.The newly built Xakapa caf, situated on the riverbank across from the popular tourist destination Lembah Anai waterfall in Tanah Datar, was swept away during the May 11 flood. Nature conservation is equally crucial because disasters like floods and landslides are often caused by natural destruction such as illegal logging and massive land conversion.Natural disasters are projected to become more frequent and catastrophic in the future as climate-related problems increase."
