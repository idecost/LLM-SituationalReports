At the same time, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are fleeing Rafah after the Israeli Defence Forces ordered further evacuations from the southern city, leading afresh to massive displacement of an already profoundly traumatized population. I am also concerned by reports of indiscriminate rocket fire from Gaza.Since 6 May, when the IDF issued an evacuation order to Palestinians in eastern Rafah, more than 278,000 people have been displaced.

I can see no way that the latest evacuation orders, much less a full assault, in an area with an extremely dense presence of civilians, can be reconciled with the binding requirements of international humanitarian law and with the two sets of binding provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice.At this desperate moment, exacerbated by acts impeding the entry of humanitarian aid in Gaza through the three crossings, there is a dire shortage of fuel, which is hindering everything  from the movement to distribution of food, operation of hospitals and emergency services, sewage treatment and telecommunications."

Continued fighting does not negate negotiations to end a conflict. But the end of the war is likely to mean the end of Benjamin Netanyahu's prime ministership and polling suggests that while most Israelis prioritise a deal to release hostages over military action in Rafah, that is reversed among the rightwing voters on whom Mr Netanyahu's future rests.The Biden administration is desperate to close down a conflict that threatens further regional escalation and is costing it precious domestic support in an election year. A week ago it told Hamas that Israel had made an \"extraordinarily generous offer\"; this time, a US official suggested that Israel had not approached the latest talks \"in good faith\"."

Humanitarian agencies have warned this will result in an even more catastrophic scenario, including a devastating surge of civilian deaths, mass forcible displacement and severe deterioration of the operating environment of humanitarian actors.Only an immediate, sustained ceasefire, full adherence to international humanitarian law IHL, and the opening of all entry points to Gaza for humanitarian and commercial supplies, including for banking, will allow civilians' basic human needs to be met.

    "paragraph": "title: Latest Gaza evacuation warnings expose weak spots in Israel's war strategy  content: Two elements are particularly striking about the latest evacuation warnings issued by the Israel Defense Forces IDF to residents and displaced people in central Rafah and a considerable part of northern Gaza.The first is that the warnings for Rafah were put at the bottom of leaflets and social media posts, almost as if the IDF was trying to downplay the coming offensive. This may be because Israeli military officials have told the media for much of the week that they were carrying out \"precise, limited and targeted\" operations in the city with the sole objective of seizing the key border crossing with Egypt. This is now clearly not the case, if it ever was.Such reluctance to highlight the opening of a new and potentially extremely bloody phase in the war in Gaza is unsurprising. For months, Israel's most senior officials have threatened a full-scale assault into Rafah to eliminate Hamas forces and leaders based in or under the city, and to retrieve some of the Israeli hostages possibly held there."

    "paragraph": "This is seen as essential to accomplishing Israel's war aims of \"crushing\" Hamas and ending any threat from the organisation.Humanitarian officials have warned of a catastrophe if such an attack goes ahead, and Washington made clear it was opposed to any such action without Israel offering a credible plan to safeguard civilians. This, US officials say, they have yet to see. The diplomatic fallout of the new Israeli push is therefore likely to be significant and long lasting.The second takeaway from the warnings is that they call for the evacuation of areas in northern Gaza that have already been the site of repeated Israeli military operations. These choices have helped its enemies, allowing Hamas to return to former strongholds, now often reduced to rubble."

This is especially true of children, they say. The supposed humanitarian zones designated by the IDF for evacuation offer pitiful provision for the huge numbers who are fleeing towards them this weekend  following the instructions in the leaflets."

The denial of humanitarian assistance is a Grave Violation against children, according to the UN Security Council's 1999 Resolution on Children in Armed Conflict, and illegal under international humanitarian law.Since the war started following the attacks on Israel on 7 October, Rafah has been the primary entry point for aid and fuel entering Gaza, with other land crossings only partially or sporadically functioning.

Over seven months, IsraAID Vanuatu will employ household visits to spread information on nutrition and hygiene, helping families understand the root causes of malnutrition and prevent stunting.According to the 2013 Vanuatu Demographic and Health Survey, about 30 of children under five are stunted in Vanuatu. Stunting is an irreversible condition that occurs when children do not receive enough nutrients to develop properly. It can be caused by poor dietary habits or by long-term exposure to fecal matter, which prevents proper absorption of nutrients.IsraAID Vanuatu will target the six communities on Emau Island, north of Efate, helping families and communities access the information they need to prevent stunting and create the conditions for their children to flourish."

The demolitions, the highest in a single day since the demolitions of Al-Araqib in 2010, amount to the forced eviction of over 300 residents of Wadi al-Khalil, one of nine unrecognized villages at risk of forced eviction under the guise of urban development. \"The scenes of hyper-militarized police units, including the notorious Yoav and border police units, storming Wadi al-Khalil to bulldoze homes and confiscate residents' belongings are yet another chilling demonstration of the cruelty and ongoing injustices and human rights violations meted by Israeli authorities upon Palestinian citizens of Israel, especially those living in the NegevNaqab,\" said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International's Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. \"Instead of meaningfully consulting with the local communities in an inclusive decision-making process on planning, infrastructure development and access to land, Israeli authorities, particularly the Bedouin Authority for Development and Settlement, continue to use urban development as a tool to displace Bedouins, disenfranchise them and force them into smaller and smaller pockets of land, in a clear illustration of Israel's apartheid system."

With this control, Israel is prohibiting aid trucks carrying life-saving supplies and fuel for humanitarian use through both the crossing's Egyptian gate and the crossing at Kerem Shalom with Israel, portending a swift worsening of the famine that is full-blown in the north and now threatening the southern part of the Strip.Keeping people and goods from crossing the border at Rafah means cutting off the only means of survival for the people living in the Gaza Strip. It also means denying families and individuals who are attempting to flee the Strip under duress their chance to escape the genocide and their right to free movement. Furthermore, by preventing the sick and injured from receiving treatment abroad, Israel is putting people's lives in grave danger, especially given the poor quality of medical care available in the Strip as a result of Israel's genocide, which has specifically targeted the health sector.As the hub for humanitarian relief efforts and the point of entry for life-saving supplies, Rafah is home to numerous operational relief organisations that stockpile food and water, plus health, sanitation, and hygiene supplies for civilians throughout the Gaza Strip."

In less than 48 hours, this bombardment has resulted in the destruction of approximately 18 homes, the majority of which collapsed on top of their occupants' heads, killing 52 Palestinians, including 17 children and 14 women.Rafah's man hospital, Abu Youssef Al-Najjar, and a nearby health centre have been evacuated in response to recent Israeli evacuation orders. This will have detrimental effects on health services, especially in view of the closure of the road leading to the European Hospital, and will jeopardise the Kuwaiti Hospital's remaining services, which include two additional field hospitals and X-ray services.The region's water pumping has also stopped as a result of the Israeli army's incursion into the areas east of Rafah, because municipal crews are unable to reach the water pump wells and make repairs.

This covers every area north of the Gaza Valley, whose residents were told to leave in late October, as well as certain areas south of the Gaza Valley that have been under constant evacuation orders from the Israeli army since 1 December 2023.Israel apparently intends to launch a massive attack on Rafahannounced 213 days into its ongoing genocidewithout considering the fate of the hundreds of thousands of residents and displaced people who have sought refuge there after the Israeli army previously declared it a safe zone. Given the volume of displaced people, storming the city poses a serious threat of massacre and raises urgent concerns about the scenario of forced displacement outside the Gaza Strip.The international community must uphold its legal and international obligations to stop Israel from committing the crime of genocide in the Gaza Strip, activate effective pressure tactics to stop Israel's military attack on Rafah, and abide by the rulings of the International Court of Justice in order to protect Palestinian civilians."

Many walked, carrying their belongings, under a searing summer sun. Last week Netanyahu said that Israel would \"stand alone\" and fight with \"fingernails\" if necessary.The IDF instructed residents to evacuate central Rafah early on Saturday morning, via leaflets and messages on social media. Analysts said this suggested Israeli forces would advance into the centre of Rafah as early as Sunday, and were likely to continue through the entire city.In a statement, the IDF said its forces \"continue to act against the Hamas terrorist organisation, which uses the residents of Gaza as human shields for its terrorist activities and infrastructure."

However, Israel provided no explanation as to how the civilian population would be safely transported to Al-Mawasi, which is west of the nearby city of Khan Yunis, or how they would be organised upon their arrival.More than 200,000 people may be targeted by the displacement orders, which also affect the Abu Youssef Al-Najjar Hospital, Rafah's main hospital, as well as the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings. It should be noted that humanitarian aid access through these crossings has been stopped since yesterday afternoon.The Israeli army's new displacement orders came with a warning that Gaza City and its north \"remain a dangerous combat zone\", making it impossible for Palestinian residents to go north. At the same time, airstrikes on residential homes in Rafah have intensified in recent hours, leaving 26 people deadthe majority of them women and childrenand dozens more wounded."

Israel launched its first aerial assault on Rafah at the start of its genocidal war on the Gaza Strip, during which hundreds of neighbourhoods and residential buildings were struck without prior warning.The Israeli army has been ordering the illegal evacuation of approximately 246 square kilometres, or roughly 67 of the Gaza Strip's total area, since 7 October 2023. This covers every area north of the Gaza Valley, whose residents were told to leave in late October, as well as certain areas south of the Gaza Valley that have been under constant evacuation orders from the Israeli army since 1 December 2023.Before beginning ground operations, the Israeli army often issues displacement orders that contain a number of serious errors, such as contradicting information and naming areas incorrectly, which prevents displaced civilians from finding safety. Additionally, Israel appears to have violated its obligation to provide \"effective advanced warnings\" under international humanitarian law.Any Israeli military operation in Rafah poses a grave risk to hundreds of thousands of civilians, particularly women and children."

Given the volume of displaced people, storming the city poses a serious threat of massacre and raises urgent concerns about the scenario of forced displacement outside the Gaza Strip.With its prior military orders to evacuate other areas of the Strip, and the weight of bombing and casualties, Israel is already conducting one of the biggest and most widespread forced displacement operations in modern history. Israel has forced roughly two million Palestinians to relocate and take up temporary homes in shelters and tents, with over half of them centred in the border city of Rafah.Furthermore, Rafah serves as a hub for humanitarian relief efforts and the point of entry for vital humanitarian supplies. Numerous relief organisations that supply food and water, plus health, sanitation, and hygiene supplies, to civilians throughout the Gaza Strip, store these supplies in Rafah."

    "paragraph": "Israel's potential ground incursion poses an existential threat to residents all over the Strip, who are currently struggling to survive, and is expected to worsen the spread of diseases brought on by the military operation.A larger wave of displacement, increased overcrowding, and the elimination of opportunities to obtain basic food and water will result from the impending Israeli ground attack on Rafah, which may be the deadliest point of escalation against Palestinian civilians. The Strip's health system, which is already nearly destroyed, would likely collapse completely. Rafah's Abu Youssef Al-Najjar Hospital, one of 12 partially operational hospitals in the Strip, out of its total of 36 hospitals, is also targeted by the new evacuation orders. The other 11 hospitals include two in northern Gaza, three in Gaza City, two in Deir al-Balah, and two in Khan Yunis, as well as three in Rafah, central, and southern Gaza."

This egregious act stands as a stark testament to the failure of the international community to stop the ongoing genocide in Gaza, as per their legal obligations, and compel Israel to adhere to the provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice ICJ. Despite clear legal obligations, Israel's actions exemplify a blatant disregard for international law and human rights, and underscore the urgent need for decisive, global intervention to prevent further massacres.On 6 May 2024, the Israeli military issued new evacuation orders directed towards eastern Rafah, specifically targeting residents and displaced persons in the Al-Shawka municipality, in the Al-Salam, Al Jneina, Tabet Ziraa, and Al-Bayouk neighborhoods, and blocks 10-16, 28, and 270, who were instructed to \"evacuate immediately\" and relocate to the so-called \"expanded humanitarian zone\" in Al-Mawasi. This directive comes amidst recent announcements by Israeli authorities regarding the expansion of the humanitarian zone in Al-Mawasi, encompassing vast neighborhoods stretching from Khan Younis to Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah."

The reality on the ground is indisputable: nowhere is safe in Gaza.According to preliminary estimates, the areas impacted by this evacuation order house more than 250,000 individuals  a significant portion of Rafah's population of over a million residents and displaced persons. In the area designated for evacuation, both the Karem Abu Salem and Rafah Crossings are located, serving as vital lifelines for the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza. The Abu Yousef Al-Najjar Hospital, Rafah's primary healthcare facility, is also situated within this designated evacuation zone."

According to our reports, Israeli warplanes conducted direct airstrikes on 10 residential homes, seven of which had residents still inside at the time of the attacks.

These developments unfold against a backdrop of intensified airstrikes and artillery bombardments by Israeli forces, targeting residential homes, streets, agricultural lands, and farms. Since the early hours of Tuesday, 7 May, Israeli attacks have killed at least 23 Palestinians, including six women and six children, as well as causing numerous injuries and leaving several individuals missing under the rubble of at least two houses."

They raised the Israeli flag inside the crossing; this alarming development serves as further evidence of Israel's intentions to eliminate Palestinian presence in Gaza and to assert control over the land.As a result, Rafah crossing was closed for the movement of people and goods both in and out of Gaza  including desperately needed, life-saving humanitarian aid. This closure places the lives of hundreds of injured and medical patients at immediate risk, effectively condemning them to death due to the lack of access to medical care. Additionally, the closure would prevent the movement of the few delegations allowed to enter Gaza, including medical and humanitarian missions, further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis and denying essential assistance to those in dire need.Amid the intensified attacks, forced displacement persists, instilling a state of terror and panic among residents and displaced persons."

As a direct consequence of the ground invasion and eviction orders, the Ministry of Health was compelled to evacuate the Abu Yousef al-Najjar Hospital. At the time of writing, only the Kuwait Hospital and three field hospitals, established during the ongoing genocide, remain operational, further exacerbating the strain on the local healthcare infrastructure.Over the past seven months, Israel has demonstrated a blatant disregard for international legal norms and the United Nations UN, repeatedly violating resolutions issued by the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly, and the UN Human Rights Council, as well as provisional measures ordered by the ICJ. The persistent impunity granted to Israel only perpetuates further atrocity crimes, as testified by the beginning of the Rafah ground invasion.Mere statements alone are insufficient to halt the invasion of Rafah or address Israel's genocidal military campaign against Palestinians in Gaza."

If, however, many believe that they have no stake in a society and that they have no real hope of sharing in its success, then turning to violence to create a place in which they believe they can meaningfully participate is far more likely.If Netanyahu understood this principle, his government would not include dangerous extremists and would not pursue policies involving the significant expansion of West Bank settlements and the recognition of illegal settlements which deny Palestinians hope for a better future. But he reached a new low when in 2022 he brought into his government the most extreme anti-Palestinian participants in Israeli politics. Their inclusion sent the clear message to Palestinians that there is no hope of a better future for them in any Israeli-controlled-land.Netanyahu invited Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir to join his government."

He has, however, suggested during a debate on an immigration bill it was a mistake in 1948 not to expel all Arabs from Israel; has asserted that \"there is no such thing as a Palestinian people;\" favors all of the West Bank being incorporated into Israel; and says he supports the voluntary moving of Palestinians out of Gaza.Ben Gvir, who has been given a national security portfolio, is arguably even worse. He has been convicted of inciting racism against Arabs and was an alleged member of a terrorist group; has idolized the killing of Palestinians; publicly threatened then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin before his assassination in 1995; and claimed that his right to travel in the West Bank was more important than the Palestinians' right to travel. And, just late last month he reportedly questioned the Israeli Defense Forces why they were taking so many Palestinian prisoners instead of killing them which would be a violation of international law.After the October 7 terrorist attack, Netanyahu had an opportunity to remove Smotrich and Ben Gvir from their posts when the first offer from the opposition for a unity government involved their elimination from the cabinet."

It also gives license to followers of these extremists to, as we have seen, attack Palestinians in the West Bank and even to attack a Jordanian aid convoy.There is no doubt that a robust military response by Israel was justified. And there also is no doubt that Hamas' embedding its fighters and military infrastructure within the civilian population has inevitably increased the dangers civilians face in Gaza."

Indeed, Netanyahu's government and its actions risk adding fuel to the dangerous fire of antisemitism. And tragically, for all too many around the world, revulsion over what his government has become risks causing them to no longer support the legitimacy of Israel itself."

    "paragraph": "Routes that remain available for use by humanitarian organizations are frequently blocked by debris, heavily congested, and contaminated with unexploded ordnance UXO. The UN Mine Action Service UNMAS reports that a considerable amount of this debris contains UXO, noting that at least 10 percent of fired ammunition potentially fails to function. Clearing all explosive threats in Gaza could take up to 14 years, UNMAS estimates. A UN assessment team surveying Khan Younis on 10 April reported that the streets and public areas were heavily contaminated with UXO, including unexploded 1,000-pound bombs at major intersections and within school premises."

    "paragraph": "The debris is also estimated to contain about 800,000 MT of asbestos and other contaminants, posing serious health and safety issues.The infrastructure damage increases travel time for humanitarian movements, leading to significant delays, mission postponements and cancellations, and additional security risks. Consequently, the capacity of humanitarian organizations to provide vital assistance to affected people is undermined. Urgent efforts to repair and reopen roads for humanitarian convoys are crucial to ensure the delivery of assistance to those most in need.Example: Incidents during coordinated missionsOn 9 April, a humanitarian organization attempted to implement a coordinated mission to Gaza city with 18,000 litres of fuel. However, like other organizations traveling to northern Gaza, the organization was required to wait at a holding point approximately two and a half kilometers south of the Israeli military Salah Ad Din checkpoint, the the militarized boundary between northern and southern Gaza."

While at the holding point, the fuel tanker encountered mechanical issues, preventing it from restarting. When an accompanying UN vehicle was dispatched to the checkpoint to explain the situation to Israeli soldiers, the team observed a Palestinian man with a gunshot wound to the head, still alive but rapidly losing blood. The organization, in coordination with OCHA, urgently requested permission from Israeli authorities to provide first aid and transport the injured man to an ambulance."

    "paragraph": "In the end, that's what leaves a massive protection gap for Palestinians.UN News: When you are speaking of attacks or any actions by settlers, what kind of clashes are those?Ajith Sunghay: There are many. In the past we used to see one settler attacking a herder or a Palestinian who is probably moving around, et cetera. What we have seen in 2023 and moving further into 2024 is much more organized settlers attacking in groups against Palestinian towns and villages and communities.They coordinate an attack, or coordinate gatherings, and then attack a community. It can be from stones and sticks to weapons, including firearms and guns, for instance."

We don't do this on our own, either.One of our chief functions is to make sure that civil society space is maintained, and we work very closely with a range of organizations - both UN as well as national and international non-governmental organizations NGOs."

We have established this network over the years.What has happened, however, over the last few years is massive shrinking of space for different reasons, and to be honest, it also comes from all three sides: Israel, the Palestinian Authority, as well as the de facto authorities. However, I think much of those restrictions come from Israel.For instance, a couple of years ago, Israel designated with no evidence, six human rights NGOs as terrorist organizations. When you do something of that sort, you will have support dwindling to these NGOs, whether we mean it or not, whether we like it or not."

    "paragraph": "In a press briefing on 7 May, UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres stated: \"I am disturbed and distressed by the renewed military activity in Rafah,\" warning that a full-scale assault on Rafah, the epicentre of the humanitarian operation, would be catastrophic and cripple all efforts to deliver critical assistance to the population. The UN Chief stressed the imperative to protect civilians whether they stay in Rafah or leave and emphasized Israel's obligation to facilitate safe and unimpeded humanitarian access into and across Gaza.Between the afternoons of 6 and 8 May, according to the Ministry of Health MoH in Gaza, 109 Palestinians were killed and 296 injured, including 55 killed and 200 injured in the last 24 hours. As of 8 May, 266 soldiers have been killed and 1,610 soldiers have been injured in Gaza or along the border in Israel since the beginning of the ground operation, according to the Israeli military. In addition, according to the Israeli media citing official Israeli sources, over 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 33 children, have been killed in Israel, the vast majority on 7 October."

Monitoring of population movements shows that people have primarily moved to Khan Younis and Deir Al Balah using vehicles, trucks and donkey carts through the three main roads connecting Rafah and Khan Younis: Salah Ad Deen Road, the Coastal Road, and Meraj Road. This will have an immediate impact on all humanitarian operations, communication networks, and banking activities. If fuel provision does not resume, this would severe the ability of aid actors to dispatch and distribute existing aid stocks, gather information on humanitarian needs, and support the functioning of bakeries."

Combined with active hostilities, this would additionally bring to a halt the already limited solid waste collection and render inoperable or inaccessible the remaining sewage pumping stations. As a result, some 1,400 tons of solid waste estimated to be generated daily in southern Gaza and sewage would accumulate, exacerbating public health concerns. The ability of families to connect during displacement in case of separation would also be compromised."

At present, and within a context where the majority of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed and more than 75 per cent of the people have already been displaced, Shelter Cluster partners have a limited number of tents available for distribution in Gaza. There is also a lack of materials, such as tarpaulins, ropes, plastic sheeting, timber, nails, and tools to build shelters or make damaged buildings habitable. Moreover, the main warehouses of Food Security Cluster partners in Rafah have become inaccessible due to hostilities and most partners would run out of food stocks in one week."

About 65,000 children in Gaza's southernmost area are estimated to have a disability, 90 per cent of children under five are suffering from one or more infectious diseases, and nearly 8,000 infants under the age of two are already acutely malnourished, UNICEF estimates. The Health Cluster has warned that there is a shortage of vaccines for routine immunization in Gaza; unless the entry of these critical supplies urgently restarts, immunization rates among children could decrease, heightening the risk of preventable disease outbreaks. Forced displacement and an expanded ground incursion in Rafah would further curtail children's access to water, food and vital medical care and would rapidly increase the number of unaccompanied and separated children, while the ability of humanitarian actors to provide them with basic support would be heavily reduced."

While in a normal situation, the practice of illegal fee collection would have constituted grounds for immediate termination of the contract between the agent and PalPay, the current conditions only one-fourth of agents working force a more prudent analysis before the termination of any agent, which might result in the impossibility to assist parts of the population in different areas. PalPay agents get 2 NIS per transaction as a fee from PalPay  regardless of the amount transferred.Some CWG agencies agreed to tackle to issue by negotiating with PalPay an increase in the fees paid by the delivering agency to allow PalPay to pay higher fees to the agents. This is coupled with clear accountability and compliance measures for agents who persist in this illicit practice."

As of 10 May, it is estimated that that 132 Israelis and foreign nationals remain captive in Gaza, including fatalities whose bodies are withheld.In a statement issued on 8 May, the Government Media Office GMO announced that a third mass grave had been discovered inside Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza city and that 49 bodies had already been recovered as exhumation efforts continued. The statement added that, with this latest discovery, the number of mass graves found inside Gaza's hospitals had risen to seven - three at Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza, three at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, and one in Kamal Adwan Hospital in North Gaza - with 520 bodies recovered in total. On 7 May, responding to a media question on this subject in Geneva, OHCHR spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani indicated that \"it is clear that mass graves exist\" and reiterated the call for an independent investigation to establish the circumstances in which individuals were killed.Since 6 May, UNRWA estimates that some 110,00 people have so far been displaced from Rafah and sought refuge in Khan Younis and Deir al Balah using vehicles, trucks, motorbikes and donkey carts."

Multiple informal displacement sites have emerged, particularly south and west of Deir al Balah and west of An Nuseirat Refugee Camp.

In a statement issued on 9 May, the Government Media Office indicated that 159 critical patients, including cancer cases, were prevented from leaving Gaza to receive treatment abroad since 7 May. According to the Health Cluster, prior to the Rafah Crossing's closure, only 58 per cent of patients for whom medical evacuations were requested had been approved by Israeli authorities 5,857 out of 10,175 and, out of all approved patients, 83 per cent could be evacuated outside Gaza 4,843. The World Health Organization WHO and its partners have also been forced to stop evacuations of patients from northern to southern Gaza due to dire shortages of fuel and increasingly shrinking bed capacity at health facilities in the south.The Health Cluster warns that, unless fuel is immediately allowed into Gaza, five hospitals and five field hospitals across the Strip will only be able to sustain operations for less than 48 hours."

The immediate resumption of fuel supply into Gaza is an urgent priority to keep alive what remains of Gaza's decimated health system, with life-saving health services hanging by a thread.Following the evacuation of An Najjar Hospital, critical patients were transferred to the Rafah Indonesian Field Hospital and Al Kuwaiti Hospital has become the main hospital in Rafah able to provide emergency care, trauma stabilization and patient referrals, subject to fuel availability. With a 36-bed capacity and two Emergency Medical Teams EMTs deployed on site, Al Kuwaiti Hospital, alongside two out of four other field hospitals in Rafah, could also potentially provide maternal services to pregnant women should Al Emirati Maternity Hospital in Rafah become inaccessible or inoperable due to the Israeli ground incursion, according to the Health Cluster."

The World Food Programme WFP stressed that current supplies of food and fuel will only last a few days, as the agency's main warehouse in eastern Rafah has become inaccessible. Without them, WFP warned, \"operations will go to a standstill,\" undermining recent improvements and the sustainability of humanitarian services.

This year, a workforce survey of members of the NASUWT union found that some teachers had been driven to the point of suicide by the stress of the job.

It was reported last month that single-phrase Ofsted judgments such as \"inadequate\" would be scrapped for more nuanced descriptors  but the Department for Education has denied this.Michael, who taught at A-level, felt a huge pressure to ensure his students achieved good grades after the Covid pandemic."

In the later lockdowns, Michael found himself teaching A-level students whose GCSEs had also been disrupted, and he saw a sharp drop in their results compared to previous cohorts. \"I started to panic a bit because I thought, I feel like I'm banging my head against a brick wall here."

A comparison of aerial photographs from September 10, 2023 and March 1 this year also showed a significant increase in the number of vehicles at the facility, indicating an uptick in activity. Satellite imagery from two dates in early December showed construction work in progress.CNN also geolocated the two leaked photographs showing the enclosure holding the group of blindfolded men in gray tracksuits. The pattern of panels seen on the roof matched those of a large hangar visible in satellite imagery."

Through a youth-led approach, the study sheds light on the multifaceted challenges. It offers strategic recommendations on increasing women's participation in decision-making and the peace process between Israel and Palestine, primarily focusing on intra-Palestinian reconciliation efforts. The findings of the study reveal two types of systematic barriers hindering women's political participation: internal, which include the patriarchal structuresinstitutions, gender stereotypes and norms, and discriminatory legislation, and external, which are linked to the impact of the occupation."

    "paragraph": "Specifically, the socio-economic disparities are both internally connected with gender norms and externally derived from the repressive occupation policies that impact the whole society. Moreover, the freezing of the electoral process, lack of resources, and the absence of comprehensive local government strategies further exacerbate women's exclusion and lack of agency. Based on the findings, the study proposes transformative strategies to enhance women's political leadership and engagement in internal decision-making and policy development to create the conditions for their meaningful contribution to peace in the region, starting from internal Palestinian reconciliation. These strategies include translating commitments such as UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security into actionable measures, dismantling patriarchal norms, fostering gender equality in public institutions and policies, and garnering political parties' support for the nomination of women for public office."

The project included capacity-building workshops and policy dialogues, and it was realised in collaboration with the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict GPPAC and with the financial support of the United Nations Women's Peace and Humanitarian Fund Rapid Response Window for Women's Participation in Peace Process.The research study delved into how and why Palestinian women should advance their demands for meaningful participation in decision-making and peace processes between Israel and Palestine and intra-Palestinian reconciliation processes.

However, when the Palestinian National Authority was established in 1994, it was predominantly led by men with rigid conservative views on women's role in society. This reinforced harmful gender stereotypes and patriarchal values that continue to pervade the Palestinian socio- cultural fabric.Today, women make up half of the population in Palestine 49. Despite globaladvancements in women's rights, Palestinian women face persistent challenges inparticipating politically at the national level."

The Gaza blockade as well as the COVID-19 pandemic have taken a heavy toll on women by limiting their ability to travel for work, increasing risks of harassment by settlers and gender-based violence GBV, and increasing rates of unemployment, particularly among young women. In 2015, the Palestinian government launched its first National Action Plan NAP on Women, Peace, and Security WPS. The NAP I aimed to protect women and girls from the impacts of Israeli occupation and conflict and increase their involvement in local and international decision- making processes.Presently, Palestine is in the process of implementing its second WPS NAP for 2020-2024."

Since 2007, Palestinian women have been systematically excluded from the internal reconciliation attempts. As one indicator of this exclusion, the recent intra-Palestinian reconciliation effort in Cairo 2023 featured only one woman out of fifty-four negotiators. Achieving transformative change in Palestine requires translating commitments of the UNSCR 1325 and the WPS Agenda into tangible actions for women's meaningful inclusion in decision-making and peace processes."

Indeed, most respondents were aware of UNSCR 1325, however, they were lacking in awareness of its achievements in increasing women's political participation.At the same time, the findings showed a positive trend in the increasing engagement and understanding of young people to influence political spaces and integrate themselves into local and national political processes through diverse channels of political action. There is a clear need to continue this trend: to increase the interest of Palestinian youth in public policymaking, as it holds the potential to generate momentum for the meaningful inclusion of women in political spheres and peace processes. All ofthese factors, respondents agreed, undermine the Palestinian Authority's efforts tocombat violence against women such as the Council of Ministers Resolution to Improve the Protection of Women Subjected to Violence 2005 and the Presidential Decree ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of All8 The total percentage may not add up to 100 due to the inclusion of other response options."

Figure 3.Figure 3: Causes of Women's Absence from Inter-Palestine NegotiationsThese findings suggest that, despite the widespread recognition that unequal power relations contribute to women's exclusion from the political decision-making and peace processes, deeply entrenched patriarchal and misogynistic beliefs persist in a big part of the population. Over 50 of the people who responded to the survey ascribed the causeof exclusion to women's lack of agency. In that vein, lasting peace and stability inPalestine can only be achieved if women become active agents for change, both in peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine and within intra-Palestinian reconciliation processes.In light of the study's findings, it is crucial to recognise and amplify the importance of women's participation in the negotiations between Palestine and Israel and in inter- Palestinian dialogues."

That figure is more than twice as many as in any other year since the UN began systematically documenting fatalities. About 300 were killed in the nearly three months following the October 7 Hamas-led attacks on Israel, though the increase in killings dates back to 2022. Children on their way to school have been fatally shot, as Human Rights Watch documented in August 2023."

These operations resulted in the killing of 304 Palestinians, out of a total of 409 killed by Israeli forces during this period.During a search-and-arrest operation near the West Bank city of Tulkarem on October 19, Israeli forces shot and killed 15-year-old Taha Mahamid and, minutes later, wounded his father, Ibrahim, who went to retrieve his body.

Israeli security forces do not use a similar pattern of unlawful lethal force against Jewish Israelis, even during disruptive demonstrations, including by West Bank settlers, that involve stone-throwing and blocking roads. This indicates that Israeli authorities use of unlawful excessive force is discriminatory and is used to further their policy of maintaining domination by Jewish Israelis over Palestinians.The Israeli rights group Yesh Din found that between 2017 and 2021, fewer than one percent of complaints of violations by Israeli forces against Palestinians, including killings and other abuses, resulted in criminal indictments. During the same period, Yesh Din found that only three soldiers were convicted for killing Palestinians, and all received short sentences of military community service."
