Other than the fact that you could potentially cause the fire to spread and damage other people's property, you could also cause health impacts as well in terms of air pollution,\" she warned.Touching on the topic of climate change and its impacts, the environmentalist said that while replanting trees must be a priority, it is important to plant the right trees."

The United Nations Secretary-General's call for a \"data revolution\" to equip countries with data systems to track and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals has encouraged countries to invest in better data collection, analysis, and measurement tools. While the increasingly available data shines a spotlight on progress, it also exposes the gaps that remain, including in access to sexual and reproductive health and rights.Consider Amina, a 28-year-old woman living in a remote village in Southeast Asia. Pregnant with her third child, she faced a long journey to the nearest clinic."

I have met women with similar stories across countries in Asia and in the Pacific, and I have seen firsthand that these inequalities in access are widening not only between countries but also within countries.Health systems are plagued by gender inequality and biases based on displacement and ethnic discrimination. Consequently, indigenous women like Amina are less likely to receive antenatal care, more likely to give birth as teenagers, and much more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes.This raises the question: Are we collecting the data we need to truly accelerate progress?"

    "paragraph": "title: The Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage Must Listen to Affected Communities  content: By Jocelyn Perry  July 9, 2024As the second meeting of the UN Climate Change UNFCCC Board of the Fund for responding to loss and damage begins this week, Refugees International urges inclusion of affected communities in both decision-making processes and direct access to funds.To support these goals, the Climate, Migration  Displacement Platform Steering Group and Refugees International hosted two virtual conversations with members of communities affected by loss and damage in the context of displacement and other forms of mobility to share their experiences, challenges, and best practices with members of the Board of the Fund for responding to loss and damage on June 26 and 27, 2024, under Chatham House rules. We organized these discussions in response to requests from Board members to hear from communities affected by displacement and other forms of mobilityas most members of these communities are unable to travel to an event such as a Board meeting due to financial and documentation challenges.Displaced communities are often some of the most marginalized, whether living within their country of origin as internally displaced people or having crossed borders as refugees or through other pathways. Their access to political processesincluding climate adaptationas well as international financing mechanisms are exceedingly limited, though they are often more exposed and more vulnerable to climate hazards than other groups. As regions and communities each experience the climate crisis and related loss and damage differently, the Fund must be both fit for purpose and flexible enough to offer a wide array of solutions to adequately tackle the crisis in each context."

    "paragraph": "While specifics look different in each regional context that we heard from, across Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, communities have already experienced and are continuing to face loss of lives, homes, and livelihoods; loss of biodiversity, cultural heritage, languages, and practices; loss of access to ancestral homelands and community cohesion; and are experiencing psychological trauma. In light of this, both economic and non-economic loss and damage must be considered and addressed. Simplicity is key for communities to be able to access funds in practice, not just in theory. Affected communities stressed that the primary barriers to accessing funds are accessibility of information, procedures, banking systems, organizational capacity, and time."

    "paragraph": "Grants should prioritize nature-based solutions and ecosystem restoration to maintain connections between traditional environmental practices and communities, respect Indigenous knowledge, support biodiversity and environmental health, and continue to build local resilience to climate change.Background: What is the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage?Loss and damage is an evolving term within international climate negotiations and policymaking, largely meaning the negative impacts of climate changethose that cannot be mitigated by emissions reduction nor adapted to. After decades of advocacy by civil society and many of the countries most affected by climate change across the Global South, the Fund for responding to loss and damage was agreed to during COP27, negotiated by a transitional committee over the next year, and operationalized at COP28 in Dubai in 2023. The Fund is a World Bank hosted financial intermediary fund, through which the Bank serves as interim trustee and host of the Fund's secretariat; the Board was appointed by respective Parties in early 2024 and first met in April and May.The Fund's stated mandate \"includes a focus on addressing loss and damage to assist developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in responding to economic and non-economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events.\" A key point for many community-based organizations from the COP28 decision that operationalized the Fund is that the World Bank must allow \"all developing countries to directly access resources from the Fund, including through subnational, national and regional entities and through small grant funding for communities.\""

The full provisional agenda for the meeting is available here.Civil society organizations have been urging the Fund to learn from and improve on other funds, in terms of both participation by civil society and access to small grants directly by communities. While they appear quite bureaucratic, the decisions that the Board makes with respect to the above issues will determine to what extent the Fund is able to achieve these goals.The Heinrich Bll Foundation provides more details on these key issues, and La Ruta del Clima has developed a more detailed look at effective participation in Board meetings. Throughout the week, the Loss and Damage Collaboration network will provide daily updates of the discussions and analysis.What Other Issues are Relevant to Loss and Damage?While the modalities for Fund access are critical to communities' ability to benefit from it, the larger issue remains filling the Fund'that is, ensuring that countries increase their pledges of support to it and that they ultimately deliver on these pledges."
