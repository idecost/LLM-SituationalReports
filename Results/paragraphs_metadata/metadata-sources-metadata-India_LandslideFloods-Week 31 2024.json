The report specifically addresses the issues faced by Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, scheduled castes and tribes, as well as other oppressed groups, emphasising the urgent need for action to address these concerns.

The new model could create maps that predict urban area flooding, which traditionally have not been accessible to urban planners. This could help identify potentially flood-prone areas in urban settings, helping officials make better-informed choices about where to allocate flood resiliency and prevention resources.Rebecca Composto, a graduate student at NC State and lead author of a paper describing the model, said that urban areas present unique challenges in collecting satellite data and tracking the flow of water. \"One of the first issues is building shadows."

Flooding from Ida lasted longer than usual in areas like Philadelphia, and this combined with a sudden break in cloud cover gave Composto just the kind of satellite data she needed.The next step was to train a machine-learning model to recognize and map flooding."

These polygons helped the machine-learning algorithm \"see\" the characteristics of satellite imagery most aligned with flooding and then map the flooding.Composto then compared the resulting map, known as a flood extent, to Federal Emergency Management Agency flood zones. These zones designate areas depending on how likely they are to flood - for example, a \"500-year\" flood zone has an approximately 1-in-500 chance of flooding each year. Other areas are deemed \"minimal flood hazard,\" which places them outside the limit of the 500-year flood designation.The model found that more flooding was occurring in these minimal hazard areas than in the 500-year zones."

Composto plans to integrate a new map displaying flood depth and make her code open source to make it easier to share with emergency-response leaders."

The frustration of Kashmiris was the result of years of Indian occupation, discrimination of Kashmiris in their own state, maltreatment of Kashmiris and denial of internal autonomy to the State, agreed through Article 370 and 35-A of the Indian Constitution.

Such laws and the maltreatment of Kashmiris through the use of brutal force are internationally challengeable violations of international law, humanitarian declarations, covenants and dozens of international pacts.While India continued massive human rights violations in IIOJK through the deployment of its over 900,000 security forces, it ended the special status of Jammu and Kashmir State illegally and unilaterally on August 5, 2019 by abrogating Article 370 and 35-A of its constitution."

In order to further its agenda of consolidation of its hold over the state, New Delhi introduced new Domicile Laws for Jammu and Kashmir in April 2020 adaptation of State laws order-2020.Under these laws, India has issued millions of domicile certificates to non-Kashmiri Hindus from various parts of India which is a grave violation of Fourth Geneva Convention. Article 496 of Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits occupying powers to transfer its own population into the occupied territory. Indeed, this is yet another aspect, covered under the blatant human rights violation.The unremitting account of massive human rights violations of Indian security forces in IIOJK over the last three decades has added a humanitarian dimension to the prevailing political nature of Kashmir dispute."

This legal appeal for the arrest of two top Indian government officials was lodged under the \"Universal Jurisdiction\". Indeed, Indian Army and its paramilitary forces have been undertaking massive human rights violation in IIOJK since 1990 through; direct killings, torture, kidnapping, extrajudicial killings as well as rape and sexual violence.With over 900,000 Indian forces deployed, IIOJK has become a war zone."

The army is primarily trained to combat foreign enemies and assist the civilian government only when law and order are beyond civilian control. For example, during the Paris Olympics, over 10,000 military personnel provided security but returned to barracks after the event. In Pakistan, however, due to the persistent failures of political and civil leaders, the army is repeatedly called upon to manage conflicts that should be the civilian government's responsibility.During my over four decades of experience, I have frequently interacted with the Army Command when they were called to assist civilians."

This standoff has led to numerous incidents of violence, including the recent clash in Gwadar where a protest by the Balochistan Yakjehti Committee turned violent, resulting in the death of one soldier and injuries to 16 others. The loss of life, whether of a protester or a soldier, is deeply painful for every Pakistani patriot, underscoring the urgent need for competent governance and peaceful resolution of conflicts.Like violent movements that should have no place in a democratic country, another deeply worrying phenomenon reflecting a serious fault line in our national fabric is the issuance of fatwas calling for the death of anyone contradicting the fatwa giver's religious philosophy."

Though the occurance of the flooding and landslides was beyond human control, the extent of the disaster was not.The first landslide hit Wayanad an hour past midnight on Tuesday. The villagers of Meppadi, Mundakkai and Chooralmala ran for their lives. Many of those who stayed were buried by landslides that followed one after the other until early dawn."

    "paragraph": "\"We thought the entire mountain was going to fall on us. We were fighting death that time,\" a villager identified only as Jayesh told India Today.The proximate cause of the disaster was unrelenting monsoon rain. The Indian Meteorological Department said Wayanad had received 28cm of rain in the 24 hours before the landslides struck and destroyed critical infrastructure like roads, bridges and power lines along with homes and crops.Kerala is no stranger to intense moonsoon rainfall given its geography, flanked by the Arabian Sea to the west and the Western Ghats mountain range to the east. But this monsoon has been particularly severe, leading to swollen rivers, landslides and extensive flooding in the southern state as also elsewhere in the country.Studies have shown that the climate crisis is making the monsoon particularly harsh, with rain falling in short and heavy bursts."

    "paragraph": "\"Climate change is drastically altering rainfall patterns in the region,\" said Dr Akshay Deoras, a researcher at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science. \"What was once a predictable monsoon season has become increasingly erratic, with long dry spells followed by sudden, intense downpours. \"This shift heightens the risk of floods and makes landslides more likely as dry soils are unable to absorb heavy rains effectively, he explained.The rainfall is also not distributed equally. While rainfall in Kerala's nothern Kannur district was 21 per cent above average between 1 June and 30 July, it was 14 per cent below average in neighbouring Wayanad and nearly 25 per cent below average in Idukki and Ernakulam."

    "paragraph": "\"The co-occurence of two extreme scenarios, landslides and rainfall deficit, in the same state reflects a strong spatial variability in this year's monsoon rainfall,\" Dr Deoras said. \"The expectation is that such a pattern would become more intense in the future if global warming continues. \"Kerala was devastated by Cyclone Ockhi in 2017 and again by massive floods in 2018, among the worst in its history.What Dr Deoras described isn't unique to Kerala. \"We see roads being constructed and widened without proper measures such as slope stability, retaining walls, or adequate drainage systems,\" said professor YP Sundriyal, head of geology at the HNB Garhwal University."

    "paragraph": "\"Such infrastructure projects, carried out without considering the region's geological sensitivity, can exacerbate the risk of landslides. \"Kerala has witnessed a construction boom in the last few decades, driven by rapid urbanisation and a growing population, that has often ignored ecological considerations. Buildings have been erected in areas prone to floods and landslides, with insufficient regard for safety regulations. The result is a landscape where natural disasters can have disproportionately severe consequences.One of the most vital components of disaster management is the implementation of effective early warning systems."

Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, emphasized the need for localised early warning systems. \"Landslide-prone areas are mapped and known, yet timely evacuation and preventive measures are often lacking,\" he said. \"We need to monitor rainfall data in these hotspots and prepare targeted early warning systems to save lives and livelihoods."

In some cases, people were unaware of imminent danger or reluctant to leave because of the lack of clear and timely information.In any case, the response to the disaster has got mired in politicking. India's home minister Amit Shah said in the parliament that the Kerala government did not gauge the severity of the situation accurately despite the federal government despatching nine National Disaster Response Force teams to the state on 23 July. \"Had those blaming the government read the warnings, the situation would have been different,\" he declared.The Kerala government denied they were warned."

The rise in air and ocean temperatures has led to a drastic increase in moisture, making the atmosphere unstable."
