The army is primarily trained to combat foreign enemies and assist the civilian government only when law and order are beyond civilian control. For example, during the Paris Olympics, over 10,000 military personnel provided security but returned to barracks after the event. In Pakistan, however, due to the persistent failures of political and civil leaders, the army is repeatedly called upon to manage conflicts that should be the civilian government's responsibility.During my over four decades of experience, I have frequently interacted with the Army Command when they were called to assist civilians."

While their presence and flag marches may initially intimidate the populace, this effect diminishes as people grow accustomed to the army's involvement in civilian matters.The involvement of the army in civilian affairs, driven by the incompetence of politicians and the civil administration, has severely damaged its image.

In Balochistan, groups like the Baloch Liberation Army BLA, Baloch Republican Army BRA, Baloch Liberation Front BLF, and United Baloch Army UBA engage in armed struggle and propaganda against the army, further complicating the situation. This standoff has led to numerous incidents of violence, including the recent clash in Gwadar where a protest by the Balochistan Yakjehti Committee turned violent, resulting in the death of one soldier and injuries to 16 others. The loss of life, whether of a protester or a soldier, is deeply painful for every Pakistani patriot, underscoring the urgent need for competent governance and peaceful resolution of conflicts.Like violent movements that should have no place in a democratic country, another deeply worrying phenomenon reflecting a serious fault line in our national fabric is the issuance of fatwas calling for the death of anyone contradicting the fatwa giver's religious philosophy."

Neither acknowledges how climate-induced migration might affect the cultures and languages of northern Pakistan.Mountainous terrain leaves small populations vulnerableOver 30 endangered' languages are spoken in Pakistan mountainous northern regions.

This leads to a gradual loss of proficiency in their native languages.When these distressed families relocate they are compelled to speak the dominant languageAmjid Saleem, University of PeshawarSamiullah Arman, who teaches at Edward College, Peshawar explains this as a fall in the \"market value\" of the language, in that it does not help people navigate their surroundings. \"The higher the market value of a language, the more people will speak it, and it will thrive,\" said Arman, who also heads the Language, Literature and Culture Department at Mafkoora, a research and development organisation working for the preservation of local languages.Agreeing with Arman, Amjid Saleem, head of the English and Applied Linguistics Department at the University of Peshawar, told Dialogue Earth that displacement due to natural disasters is not just the displacement of individuals but rather of cultures. \"When these distressed families relocate they are compelled to speak the dominant language as their native tongue is rarely spoken in schools and marketplaces They quickly try to learn the dominant language to overcome their sense of alienation, and this way a language erodes slowly and gradually,\" he said.Languages only spoken at home Dr Rubina Sethi, a retired teacher at the Department of English and Applied Linguistics, University of Peshawar, emphasised that women play a crucial role in preserving a language, but the influence of this preservation depends on what children encounter outside their homes."

Those with the means to migrate have already done so, leaving behind only those lacking the necessary resources."

The BYC is a prominent civil rights movement advocating for the protection of civil, political, and economic rights, and calling for an end to enforced disappearances and custodial killings of Baloch in Balochistan.On July 27, the Frontier Corps, a paramilitary force in Pakistan, opened fire on buses heading to Gwadar for the Baloch National Gathering, injuring at least 14 people in Mastung, about 60 km 35 miles west of Quetta. The authorities set up blockades across the province to restrict movement, leading to further violence.The crackdown intensified on July 28, with security forces killing at least three protesters in Gwadar and injuring dozens more. On July 29, police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators, with reports of security forces firing on protesters on the outskirts of Gwadar on July 30.Since July 27, the Balochistan government has blocked roads and highways and cut off internet access, isolating Gwadar  a city once hailed for its potential as an emerging port similar to Dubai."

Still, the indigenous residents of Gwadar and ethnic Baloch complain that their resources are being plundered with little benefit to them.The Baloch have engaged in peaceful political activism against both Islamabad and China, while insurgents have also targeted Chinese interests with violent attacks. The ongoing unrest casts a shadow over the town's future and raises concerns about its stability and the viability of Chinese investment.In recent years, China has faced significant security challenges in Pakistan, with Baloch nationalist insurgents in Balochistan and Islamist militants in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa frequently attacking Chinese workers. The general public also appears increasingly unhappy with Chinese investment."

Today, Gwadar is still heavily dependent on neighboring Iran for electricity, while its nearly 100,000 residents rely on natural sources such as rain and traditional dams for water.In recent months, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee has emerged as a harsh critic of Chinese investment in Gwadar. The BYC is an influential and popular group in Balochistan, largely due to its peaceful struggle for Baloch rights. It vocally addresses human rights issues plaguing Balochistan, especially enforced disappearances, custodial killings, and the exploitation of Balochistan's resources."

    "paragraph": "The BYC's agenda resonates deeply with the Baloch public, which is why the group has earned considerable trust in Balochistan in a remarkably short time.The BYC's main demand is an end to enforced disappearances in Balochistan, which the group's leadership rightly calls illegal and unconstitutional. The economic and social reforms undertaken in the early 1970s by Pakistan's former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto should have served as a roadmap for containing the current insurgency in Balochistan. Instead, Pakistani rulers have embarked on even more political adventures, including forcefully disappearing political activists, banning political parties, and cracking down on peaceful rights movements.In recent times, a popular peaceful rights movement in the form of the BYC has gained the trust and attention of not only the Baloch population  from Balochistan to Karachi and Dera Ghazi Khan in southern Punjab, where a huge population of Baloch lives  but also other political stakeholders in Balochistan, regardless of their stance on Pakistan's parliamentary politics. Both hardline nationalists who reject Pakistan's parliamentary politics and political parties in Balochistan deeply respect the BYC because of its considerable public support."

The failure of various governments to resolve these issues has deepened mistrust between the center and Baloch youth. This erosion of confidence in Baloch parliamentary parties has led the public to support alternate voices like the BYC, which has refrained from participating in elections or joining assemblies in Pakistan.Despite this, the BYC has been attempting to find solutions within the framework of the constitution of Pakistan. For this reason, the group organized a month-long sit-in in Islamabad from December to January, where they were also mistreated."

For the first time, a peaceful rights movement is led by young women, who make up the majority of BYC supporters. These young women have challenged the cultural status quo and outdated traditions, as well as the power corridors in Pakistan. They have inspired ordinary Baloch by removing the fear that has long held them back.Movements like the BYC are rare in the region, particularly because women are at the forefront."

Her personal experience and commitment to the cause resonate deeply with ordinary Baloch.Engaging leaders like Mahrang Baloch and having a political dialogue with the BYC represented a crucial opportunity for Pakistan's political and military leadership, which has long dreamed of talking to Baloch nationalists to find a solution to Balochistan's conundrum. However, due to a lack of political seriousness in Balochistan, this opportunity has been nearly missed.The provincial government of Balochistan likely missed this chance deliberately, as the current government representatives in Balochistan do not believe in political dialogue. Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti, a staunch supporter of the powerful military and Pakistan's former caretaker interior minister just before the elections, was brought into power through what many see as hijacked elections."

His and his administration's reliance on violence to address public grievances and maintain power has led some to describe them as artificial leaders, having used coercion rather than democratic processes to secure their positions.The state's harsh treatment of the BYC last week has only reinforced the narrative that peaceful activism has no place in Balochistan. This will ultimately benefit the Baloch separatist insurgents, who have long said that peaceful activism is futile in Pakistan. By using force against a peaceful movement with large public support, the Pakistani government risks driving more Baloch youth toward a violent insurgency.This will, over the years, create greater challenges not only for Islamabad in tackling Balochistan's two-decade-long insurgency and finding a solution to the province's issues but also for China in investing in Balochistan, especially in Gwadar."

Most significantly, though, it offers recommendations for the transfer value for daily wages. Since the economic context is always changing, the transfer value will be regularly reviewed to ensure that it remains relevant. Additionally, by utilizing this document, the sector hopes to guarantee consistency throughout the various interventions, addressing potential conflicts that may emerge from partners' employing different strategies and offering different conditions, especially the transfer value.What is Cash for Work\"Cash for Work\" CfW is a program where participants receive cash payments in exchange for performing specific types of work."

    "paragraph": "This approach is often used in humanitarian and development contexts to provide immediate income support to individuals or households, while also contributing to community infrastructure and development projects. CfW programs create temporary income generation opportunities for people, especially in regions with high unemployment rates or during times of economic downturns. Furthermore, the work performed under CfW programs often involves projects that benefit the community, such as repairing roads, building schools, improving water and sanitation facilities, or cleaning up public spaces. These projects can enhance local infrastructure and services."

Training and capacity-building components are sometimes included in these programs.Cash for work in LebanonFollowing the economic crisis in Lebanon in 2019, the Livelihoods sector and its partners significantly expanded labor-intensive programming to provide Cash for Work CfW opportunities to the most vulnerable community members. This initiative aimed to address the immediate needs of those severely impacted by the crisis, such as low-income families, refugees, women, youth, and people with disabilities. By offering temporary employment, CfW programs provided essential cash payments, helping participants meet their basic needs like food, rent, and healthcare."

    "paragraph": "This comes from several factors: - The cash for work duration normally extends over 40 days which does not constitute fixed or long-term employment. - The sectors in which cash for work activities are implemented are those identified by the Government of Lebanon as allowed sectors agriculture, construction, and environment- cleaning joined with a lack of clear text requiring work permits in these sectors. - The administrative challenges in relation to sponsorship especially given the usually high number of beneficiaries, inability of both implementing organizations or contractors in case available to assume this role, and the time needed to obtain these permits which might exceed the initial activity timeframe.Duration of activitiesThe average number of workdays for each cash for work activity beneficiary is 40 days, 7-8 hours per day. This recommendation comes from the understanding of the labor law that reaching three months on a \"job\" entail that it is a fixed employment."

As such, to have a meaningful intervention, the partners can apply a minimum of 40 days and a maximum of 60 days per round.Transfer value To identify and ensure a fair and meaningful transfer value, the sector considered two different variables:The Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket SMEB: a metric used to estimate the minimum cost of necessities that a household needs to survive. This typically includes essential items like food, water, shelter, and basic hygiene products. The WFP Lebanon Situation Reportii which regularly monitors and updates the SMEB in Lebanon, identified the monthly cost of the full Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket SMEB in March 2024 at LBP 36.5 million USD 403 for a family of five which was an increase by 5 percent from February of the same year."

It is established by law or by contract to ensure a basic standard of living for employees and to protect workers from exploitation and unfairly low pay.

Secondly, allocating a budget specifically for childcare, ranging between USD 3,000 to 20,000 based on project locations, ensures sustained accessibility for women participants throughout the project duration. The childcare budget could be channelled to nurseries nearby, establishing a child-friendly space, or rehabilitating a close nursery. It is also worth noting that child-care is preferable to be close to the women'shousehold and not the project site, so women do not have to pay transportation for the child."

    "paragraph": "The SNHR report examines the degree to which the Syrian Arab Republic has complied with the ICCPR's articles, including its international obligations to ensure the most prominent human rights, with these observations drawing upon the data gathered throughout our years of monitoring and documentation. The report fo- cuses specifically on various types of violations committed by the Syrian regime over the last four years from August 2020 until June 2024, which are related to Articles 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 25, and 26 of the ICCPR. In the report, SNHR clearly illustrates how Syria has reached rock bottom in respect to many fundamental human rights, becoming one of the world's worst countries in terms of committing various types of violations. With the Syrian regime3 led by Bashar Assad remaining in power, we've documented the commission of many crimes of killing, arrest, enforced disappearance, torture, and restriction of freedoms by regime forces, especially by the regime's securi- ty apparatus, with many of these violations amounting to crimes against humanity."

SNHR has also taken part in a formal briefing session by submitting a video package summarizing the SNHR report, including recommendations to the Committee, as part of the agenda of the UN Human Rights Committee's 141st Session. It should be noted that SNHR previously submitted a report to the UN Human Rights Committee prior to the committee officially approving the list of issues related to the Syrian Arab Republic during its 130th session, which was held in the last quarter of 2020.4The report, which was submitted by SNHR in early-June 2024, draws upon the informa- tion archived on the group's database, mainly focusing on the rights to life and to liberty and security of person, as well as the violations related to arrests; unlawful detentions; enforced disappearance, torture and inhumane punishments and treatment; freedom of opinion, expression, and peaceful assembly; freedom to hold political views, and the freedom to form political parties, and freedom to participate in free elections, in addi- tion to violations related to the issue of refugees, internally displaced persons IDPs, and the freedom to movement."

Indeed, as the report notes, the current constitution blatantly contravenes the most fundamental human rights."

Furthermore, the conscious decisions to carry out these practices have been issued from the very pinnacle of the regime's power hierarchy, starting with the Pres- ident of the Republic, who directly controls the ministries of interior and defense, the National Security Bureau, and their various subsidiary security agencies and security and military committees. The report adds that there are no legal grounds for convicting de- tainees and leveling charges against them, whether on the basis of the Counterterrorism Law or the Public Penal Code, with rulings usually being based on confessions extracted under torture and coercion. These are not genuine courts in any recognized legal and judicial sense.The report further stresses that the legislative process in Syria has been stripped of all standards regulating legislation, especially those related to the conflict."

Also, the political transition process must be supported, and pressure must be imposed in order to to compel the parties to implement the political transition within a period of no more than six months so that most of the violations end and millions of displaced people can safely return to their homes.

    "paragraph": "In the closing observations, the Committee expressed its concern for the con- tinued arbitrary deprivation of life and the human rights violations taking place in the context of the armed conflict in Syria. Moreover, the Committee mentioned systematic violations that are being perpetrated in regime-held areas; including torture, arrests, sex- ual violence, and enforced disappearance. The UN Human Rights Committee urged the Syrian Arab Republic to intensify efforts to \"protect the right to life, and to give effect to the rights to truth, justice and full reparation of victims of the armed conflict. The Com- mittee specifically asked the Syrian regime's government to conduct prompt, thorough, and independent investigations into all alleged human rights violations against civilians committed during the ongoing armed conflict, bring perpetrators to justice, and provide full reparation to victims or family members."

    "paragraph": "\"The Committee has also pinpointed a pattern of enforced disappearance cases since the start of the conflict, with the majority of those cases \"allegedly attributable to gov- ernment forces.\" The Committee also expressed concern over the fact that there are no official records of disappeared people or judicial procedures put in place to address these violations. In this context, the Committee urged the Syrian regime's government to adopt urgent measures in order to \"address and prevent enforced disappearances, par- ticularly to revise its legal framework to ensure that all forms of enforced disappearance are clearly defined in criminal law.\" In addition, The Committee called for fighting impu- nity in Syria and ensure that all perpetrators, once found guilty, face justice according to the gravity of these offenses.Additionally, the UN Human Rights Committee has called on the regime to reveal the fate and whereabouts of disappeared persons, and in cases of deaths, identify them and return their remains, as well as ensure that families are regularly informed of the progress and findings of investigations, provided with the official administrative documents as dictated by international standards, and receive full reparations, including rehabilitation, adequate compensation, and non-repetition guarantees."

    "paragraph": "Moreover, the Committee called on the Syrian regime's government to fully cooperate with the UN Independent Institu- tion on Missing Persons in Syria, and consider ratifying the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.---While the Committee welcomed the promulgation of Act No. 16 of 2022 on the Criminali- zation of Torture, it has recognized, and expressed concerns over, the widespread torture practice and ill-treatment, which at times lead to death, still rampant in regime deten- tion centers. The Committee underlined that \"Act No. 16 of 2022 lacks clear investigative mechanisms and an independent mechanism for the oversight and enforcement of the law and its implementation and does not guarantee redress for former victims of torture due to the absence of retroactive application provisions.\""

    "paragraph": "The Committee also expressed concerns over \"legislative provisions which could possibly provide immunities for em- ployees of the State Security Department for crimes committed whilst carrying out their duties.\" In this context, the Committee urged the Syrian regime to take immediate action to end torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment, including re- viewing its legislative framework, such as Act No. 16 of 2022, in order to ensure it is fully compliant with the provisions of the ICCPR.Meanwhile, the Committee welcomed a number of measures taken by the Syrian regime, including the adoption of Legislative Decree No. 32 of 2023, which dissolves Military Field Courts."

    "paragraph": "However, an important distinction must be made here; Legislative Decree No. 32, promulgated by the Syrian regime on September 3, 2023, actually mandates the cessation of Legislative Decree No. 109, dated August 17, 1968, and its amendments, which established Military Field Courts. All cases previously handled by these military courts are to be transferred to military judiciary to be prosecuted according to Syrian Penal Code and Military Procedural Law, issued by Legislative Decree No."

    "paragraph": "61 of 1950 and its amendments. According to numerous indicators identified by SNHR, the Syrian regime ended the operations of the Military Field Court after it had completed most of the cases it was examining, especially those related to individuals referred to it due to political opin- ions and the conflict. The Court had issued numerous judgments against them, including death sentences. We have documented that the Syrian regime carried out executions a few months before the promulgation of Decree No."

    "paragraph": "Moreover, the transfer of cases that were being examined by the field court to the military judiciary is considered a formal procedure, as security agencies still have the authority to detain, investigate, and charge detainees, and determine which court they will be referred to: the military judi- ciary, the Counterterrorism Court, or civilian criminal judiciary. Furthermore, the military judiciary is under the Ministry of Defense, which previously controlled the Military Field Court, making it a non-independent judiciary, where the Minister of Defense has broad powers. The military judiciary is similar exceptional courts, and the sentences it issues do not differ much from those of the Military Field Court, especially since most judges who served in the military field court have been reappointed in the military judiciary. On top of that, the effects of the rulings issued by the military field court remain in effect, such---as the enforced disappearance of those referred to it and the confiscation of properties, among other rulings."

    "paragraph": "Therefore, this step is merely a nominal and formal procedure that does not have a real impact on detainees and forcibly disappeared persons. On Septem- ber 12, 2023, SNHR issued a report entitled, An Instrument of Death and Disappearance: How the Syrian Regime Uses Military Field Courts Against Activists and Dissidents' in which we documented that the Syrian regime executed 7,872 individuals, including 114 children and 26 women, out of at least 14,843 death sentences documented by SNHR as being issued by Military Field Courts. Moreover, at least 24,047 individuals, including 98 children and 39 women, of those referred to Military Field Courts since March 2011 have been forcibly disappeared and their fate remains unknown.The Committee stated that, by no later than July 23, 2027, the State Party, namely the Syrian Arab Republic, is to provide information about the implementation of the recom- mendations made by the Committee on enforced disappearance, access to justice, and children rights. The Committee also specified that the State Party submits its next peri- odic report by July 23, 2030, which should include specific up-to-date information on the implementation of the recommendations made in the present concluding observationsThe report submitted by the Syrian regime's government can be found on this link, while the report submitted by SNHR can be found on this link.---infosnhr.org  No justice without accountability  Syrian Network For Human Rights SNHR, July 2024"
