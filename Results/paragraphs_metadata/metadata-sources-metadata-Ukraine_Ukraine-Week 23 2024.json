At least 15 people died, 80 settlements were flooded, more than 37,000 houses were damaged, and the water supply system for a million people was destroyed when the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station dam was ruined in an explosion, according to the UN.Some of the territories flooded then are under Russian military occupation and the international community has been denied humanitarian access to them."

    "paragraph": "When HRMMU has not yet verified a casualty or reported an individual case of death or injury, it does not necessarily mean that HRMMU has established the individual as an active member of an armed group or as someone who directly participated in hostilities. In many cases, the non-designation of an individual as a civilian reflects a lack of information, rather than confirming the individual's status as a combatant. The actual extent of civilian harm  both casualties and infrastructure damage  is likely considerably higher as many reports of civilian harm, particularly from the period immediately after the full-scale armed attack, have not been possible to verify due to the large number of reports and the lack of access to relevant areas. This concerns, for example, Mariupol Donetsk region, Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk Luhansk region, where there were allegations of high civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure."

This highlights the critical role of parental engagement in fostering safe behaviour among adolescents.Myths about mines affecting perceptions of safe behaviour  According to the qualitative phase of the study, a significant proportion of adolescents believe in common myths about EOs. These include misconceptions that using a mobile phone near a mine can trigger its detonation, that an EO will become inert after lying in the ground for several years, that it is safe to touch unexploded ordnance or detonated mines and approach anti-tank mines, and that mines can be touched carefully if sappers have already removed the TNT. \"Russia's war has already left Ukraine with a deadly legacy of explosive ordnance and mines, which will take decades to clear."

Children, adolescents, youth and their caregivers across Ukraine are learning life-saving rules through behaviour change campaigns, interactive community engagement activities and special projects, such as Mobile Safety Classes, cartoons and comics featuring Patron the Dog. UNICEF has also launched a special online course for educators, rescuers and police on how to deliver effective EORE messages to children and youth.About the studyThe comprehensive study on mine safety awareness and safe behaviour practices among caregivers and children aged 10 to 17 was conducted from 16 to 25 March 2024. The study aimed to identify the factors that contribute to children's risk-taking behaviour with explosive ordnance and to identify these risk groups."

    "paragraph": "Visual limitation was the most reported condition with a low level of severity, while remembering and self-dressing were less reported with a higher severity level.Priority needs The 2023 MSNA highlighted specific priority needs for the refugees coming from Ukraine, including about access to healthcare services, employment and livelihoods, language courses, accommodation options, food and medicines. A comparative analysis of data between those HH with at least one member with disability and HH with no member with disability shows that slightly more priority needs were reported by the former group between 86-89, compared to the latter 81. While reported needs in the group with no members with disability were widely spread, the most cited priorities needs for HH with at least a person with disability were healthcare services and medicines. An interesting observation which needs to be further explored is the fact that accommodation and employmentlivelihood was reported as a problem by less HH with disabilities than in those without members with disabilities."

In general, HH with a person with disability reported being benefited in a larger scale, while between 47 and 37 of HH with a person with disability reported being covered by the Slovak social protection system. This presents a significant difference compared to HH without members with disability 15 which is easily understandable, as the Slovak social protection system is designed to support the most vulnerable groups, with a specific cash assistance to persons with disabilities. Similar results were obtained on the benefits received from the Ukrainian social protection system, however, only 4 of HH without a member with disability reported being covered by this assistance."

Considering that, as per the MSNA results, access to employment and language courses remain among the top priority needs for the overall refugee population, thus, the findings for those with disabilities indicates considerable needs in connection with their vulnerabilities.In addition, it can be observed that HH with a person with disability are exposed to more vulnerabilities and challenges towards their inclusion in the host community. Children with vulnerabilities face major barriers in accessing education28, thus severely limiting their prospects of accessing lifelong learning and livelihoods opportunities. HH with a person with disability are more likely to adopt negative coping strategies 56 on HH with a person with disabilities, compared to 39 on HH without persons with disabilities, and are more at risk of economic vulnerability, such as lower income, lower employability and limited access to financial systems which may result in higher poverty rates and social exclusion.Yet, HH with a person with disability presented less challenges in accessing the healthcare system; which it can be related to their need of using frequently this type of services, being more awared and familiarized with them, or living in an accommodation type where health services are provided as Humenne."

As such, examining the connections between disability and aging may contribute to more nuanced understandings to improve well-being and quality of life and enhance service provision.29Improvement of the accessibility to information on refugee rights for the different types of difficulties, including official sources, remains an important gap in the response.

Positioning Sectoral Cash and Voucher Assistance in HealthSeveral assessment findings have highlighted an increase in household expenditures on health mostly related to the purchase of medicines since the 2022 escalation of the war. This is evidenced by the 2nd round of the Multi-Sector Needs Analysis MSNA, 2023, the WHO Health Needs Assessment HNA 3, and other surveys repeated to gauge population's perceptions on health and barriers to services, including financial ones.The Ukraine humanitarian response has followed up commitments put forth in the Grand Bargain to prioritize cash assistance where possible.

Sectoral cash and voucher assistance in health shouldn't disrupt regular functioning of the health system but should complement it with a clear phase-out strategy incorporated during the planning process.Ukraine CVA for Health Framework conceptual modelThe Ukraine CVA for Health Framework is informed by the Tanahashi framework, a conceptual model used in public health to assess bottlenecks and improve access to health care services."

Vouchers in healthcare therefore, must aim at facilitating access to services for a specific pre-identified category of beneficiaries including vulnerable persons who would be unable to access these services without such planning. These results indicate the inability of those most affected by the war to access health services and medications in front line communities.In response to these gaps, humanitarian actors have been inclined to facilitate access, enabling health care availability in communities most affected by the war. While partners delve to provide immediate solutions, the approach should aim at fostering the use of mechanisms set by the MoH where available, including facilitating access to the AMP through mobile pharmacies, UkrPoshta and other means."

    "paragraph": "Health partners should encourage patients to access national services provided free-of-charge where the war has not rendered such services damaged or destroyed.Partners making arrangements should adhere to the following principles:Promote the use of the Ukrainian AMP pharmacies, UkrPoshta and Government Mobile pharmacies where services are available and not absent due to the war. Primarily encourage the use of medicines providedmentioned under the above government frameworks. Avoid programming which encourages patient access to medicines outside government frameworks when these or their equivalents are available. Only temporarily cover gaps of services medicines not available as part of the government framework, by making arrangements for these using a voucher system with a third-party provider."

    "paragraph": "Such patients should be identified and mapped prior to initiating the health project.---Cash assistance to patients to procure medicines themselves should be avoided. Where transportation is required, modalities avoiding direct cash transfer is encouraged and the partner facilitates these using existing transportation networks. Partners will be required to discuss locally with the local departments of health to provide evidence on the consideration of medicines from the EML list.Vulnerability and targeting criteriaWhile all of Ukraine has been affected by the ongoing war, the Cluster's estimation and analysis of needs shows a decreasing severity of humanitarian needs as the distance from active hostilities increases, while those in the southern, eastern, and northern oblasts bordering the front line are more severe. Individual status: The elderly and people with disabilities, who have difficulties in accessing health care, pregnant women children, who are at risk of several health issues, people without documentation in need of health care services."
