To address this gap, in 2023 the ICRC published a new report  Childhood in Rubble: The Humanitarian Consequences of Urban Warfare for Children  drawing from existing literature, 52 interviews with experts, and the organization's firsthand experience.In this post, three of the report's contributors set out eight overlooked ways that children are affected by urban warfare and outline a set of legal, policy and operational recommendations that states, non-state armed groups and humanitarians could implement to elevate the protection of children from media rallying cry to political priority.Read more on ICRC Humanitarian Law and Policy blog"

The spokesperson added that thousands of civilians are trapped.A bloody power struggle has been raging in Sudan for approximately 16 months between the Sudanese Armed Forces headed by Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces RSF paramilitary group, under the command of Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. According to the United Nations, the conflict has triggered the largest refugee crisis in the world, with more than ten million people displaced or forced to flee, many of them multiple times. The conflict has also led to nearly 15,000 deaths.The World Food Programme WFP and several aid organisations have warned of an imminent famine."

More than six million Sudanese face food insecurity across Darfur, with more than 25 million, or about half the population, in a similar situation across the country.It was unclear if the food had reached Kreinik by Thursday. The RSF, which has looted aid trucks and warehouses on numerous occasions according to aid agencies, welcomed the deliveries in a statement late on Wednesday.A document by the army-aligned Humanitarian Aid Commission showed that the procedures set by the government included the presence of Sudanese authorities and soldiers at Chadian warehouses and the border for inspections.READ: 500 days of war in Sudan: Why has the world forgotten its largest humanitarian crisis?"

The conflict in Sudan has led to the country's largest humanitarian crisis, with high levels of food insecurity. International aid groups are struggling to respond, but communal kitchens have stepped up, providing meals and emotional support to hundreds of thousands in Khartoum.In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 29 aid workers have been killed, injured, or kidnapped in the past two years. Official aid efforts are focused on IDP camps in Goma, but \"undesignated humanitarians\" are stepping in to support those in surrounding villages and towns."

Two weeks later, a medical volunteer with Mdecins Sans Frontires was killed in Khartoum when the Rapid Support Forces launched an artillery attack on Al Nao Hospital  the only functioning medical facility in the area. Just days after that, two Congolese aid workers with Tearfund were killed in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo when a rogue armed group attacked and set ablaze their convoy.These incidents are devastating reminders of the growing dangers for those courageous individuals undertaking humanitarian work around the world. Last year was the deadliest on record for aid workers, with 280 people losing their lives."

An estimated 300 million people will require humanitarian assistance and protection this year due to natural disasters, acute food insecurity, and conflict. Humanitarian workers are vital in responding to all of these crises  delivering meals, clean water, and emergency medical care to those affected."

The Government's Refugees and Returnees Service RRS and UNHCR are coordinating the response to the new refugee inflows, including daily border monitoring, screening for asylum-seekers and refugees, and coordinating the provision of basic services, such as food, water as well as emergency healthcare, together with partners.In Kurmuk, border points remain volatile with the potential for abduction, and other protection risks. The proximity to the conflict at the border perpetuates trauma and anxiety among refugees, hindering their ability to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity. Relocation to the new Ura Settlement started on 17 June, and so far more than 3,000 individuals have been relocated.In Metema, physical security is of concern, and access to services, in particular life saving services such as health care is also challenging as there is a lack of an ambulance."

This war seeks to reshape Sudan, its State, demography and potentially its map to further the agenda of an avaricious regional power, with the tacit approval or indifference of certain global actors. The international community is fully aware of the severe atrocities and violations of international humanitarian law perpetrated by the Militia against our people. I affirm that our armed forces SAF are fully capable of defeating the Militia."

We in Sudan, therefore, call upon all peace-loving nations, as well as international and regional organizations, to unequivocally condemn external interference in Sudan's internal affairs and demand these countries cease supporting the rebel militia with money, weapons, and mercenaries. We believe this is the shortest path to ending the war. We also appeal to all nations, particularly our sisterly and friendly countries, to condemn the crimes and atrocities committed by the Militia, along with its serious violations of international humanitarian law."

Unfortunately, the lenient or empathetic attitude of several influential members of the international community toward the Militia's disregard for the Declaration and relevant UN Security Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 2736 2024, only serves to advance the Militia's strategy of buying time and evading serious peace commitments.Regarding the humanitarian situation, Sudan is committed to protecting and delivering aid to those in need."

The Militia's strategy involves preventing farming in key food-producing regions by stealing agricultural machinery, inputs and harvests, blocking irrigation canals, terrorizing farmers, obstructing relief deliveries and looting major food warehouses. Nevertheless, according to the latest joint survey conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture and UN specialized agencies, there is only a minor deficit in staple grains in the country, a matter that occasionally happens due to different reasons, such as rain shortage.As a contingency plan, we will cultivate sufficient quantities of sorghum, the main staple grain, in safe states, even those where it is not traditionally grown. For wheat, which is primarily consumed in urban centers, the country will continue to rely on imports."

This crisis coincides with the second consecutive year of agricultural failure due to the devastating war, which has prevented the cultivation of essential food crops in key agricultural regions.The dire situation is further exacerbated by the difficulty of delivering humanitarian aid to affected areas due to obstruction by both warring parties. They impede aid convoys, often resorting to confiscating and even diverting supplies for their own use. This year's unusually severe autumn rainy season has also disrupted major roads, destroyed bridges, and further hindered the delivery of crucial humanitarian assistance.Numerous international organisations, including the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO, the World Food Programme WFP, the United Nations Office for Humanitarian Affairs OCHA, the UN Children's Fund UNICEF, and others, are actively monitoring the situation in Sudan."

Humanitarian workers and volunteers also face threats ranging from arrests and prolonged investigations to restrictions on movement, systematic targeting, and confiscation of the desperately needed aid they bring to assist citizens impacted by the war.The numerous restrictions imposed on civil society organisations and grassroots committees serving local communities have severely hampered their ability to gather information, assess the situation, and issue calls for assistance. Communication blackouts have further compounded these challenges by limiting communication capabilities and hindering access to funding via banking applications, which have become the sole means of transferring money.The local and foreign media face a similar predicament, unable to adequately report on the humanitarian crisis affecting refugees and displaced people due to restrictions, communication disruptions, and internet outages. Journalists are not permitted to operate freely in covering these critical issues, often forced to work in secrecy, which is entirely incompatible with the nature of their work."

From a humble house in the eastern town of Kassala, I am supporting 12 displaced people, all of them family members uprooted by the fighting that has spread through my country.I am not alone in doing this.

In Sudan, when you host people, you are expected to spend time and chat with them.
