This is significantly below the usual number of people reached by WFP, as a result of Israeli-imposed bureaucratic hurdles, lack of security guarantees within Gaza, insufficient border crossing points, and risk of criminal gangs looting humanitarian convoys in South Gaza. Forced population movement has also disrupted the capacity of partners to maintain operations and distribute to those in need. While hot meals and the distribution of fresh bread through bakeries continue, WFP will no longer distribute food baskets through its general food distributions across Gaza in October as the flow of essential goods has been critically restricted."

It is impossible for me, with the world as it is, to celebrate anything. \"\"I believe the Israeli government is the most radical government in Israel's history, and that its committing crimes against humanity, that its committing crimes under international law, investigated by the International Criminal Court, and that obviously, the atrocious, terrible, and condemnable brutal attacks by Hamas on October 7 do not justify the total punishment the massive punishment that the Palestinian population is enduring,\" he continued.He stressed the need: \"For different mediators to come into play because the Netanyahu government and the leaders of Hamas will never reach an agreement. \"OPINION: In Netanyahu's warped mind, committing war crimes is Israel's rightBardem criticised Israel's allies, exclaiming: \"I believe countries like the US, Germany, the UK, especially, need to rethink their logic of behaviour and unconditional support when we are witnessing crimes against human rights, crimes under international law."

This has been compounded by the destruction of 60 of Gaza's structures due to fighting and bombardment, including civilian infrastructure such as schools, religious buildings, hospitals and bakeries.Amidst these dire conditions, humanitarian organizations, including the IRC and our partners, have been working to deliver humanitarian relief to Palestinians in Gaza. However, increasing restrictions on the delivery of life-saving humanitarian aid, including destruction of infrastructure, bureaucratic impediments, Israeli attacks on aid convoys and killings of aid workers, mean that many Palestinians in Gaza are not getting the aid they need to survive.As the only way to protect Palestinian lives, and enable the release of the remaining hostages, the IRC continues to call for an immediate and lasting ceasefire. In the meantime, the IRC is calling on all parties with influence to put in place a \"humanitarian reset\" that will allow for an immediate and significant scale up of humanitarian aid to those in need.The only way to fully address the humanitarian access challenges in Gaza is a ceasefire paired with a comprehensive \"humanitarian reset\" that includes immediate action to:- Open all land border crossings to goods and personnel- Streamline inspection processes and list of permitted supplies- Facilitate eased entry of humanitarian and healthcare staff- Ensure safe movement for all humanitarian and healthcare workers- Fully reinstate critical services like water, power, and fuel suppliesNotes to EditorsIn Gaza, the IRC has deployed 12 teams of emergency medical personnel EMTs on a rotational basis; launched a Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition program and delivered 1,700 cartons of Ready to Use Therapeutic Food to northern Gaza."

Considering the scale of the Israeli attacks against heavily populated civilian areas, these can be considered as flagrant violation of article 51 and constitute a Crime of aggression under Chapter VII of the UN Charter requiring UN security Council's intervention.---In addition, the heavy collateral damage of the attacks also contravenes key principles of international humanitarian law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention GCIV, which mandates the protection of civilian populations during armed conflicts.

The area is incredibly overcrowded, and sanitary conditions are appalling. Food is scarce and the lack of clean water and hygiene products is causing outbreaks of diarrhoea and skin diseases. Shampoo, detergent, and dishwashing liquid are largely absent from the market, or available at skyrocketing prices, which most people in Gaza cannot afford."

The constant Israeli attacks have damaged more than 370,000 housing units; 79,000 homes have been destroyed completely. About 68 of cropland and roads have also been severely damaged. As of September 2024, only 17 of 36 hospitals remain partially functional, while all suffer from a lack of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water."

There is an almost total absence of fresh vegetables, fruit, and protein sources such as poultry and meat in the markets in Gaza City and across north Gaza. Between 7 October 2023 and 23 September 2024, 693 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. In the same period, Israeli authorities demolished, confiscated, or forced the demolition of 1,725 Palestinian structures, such as homes, agriculture, and water and sanitation structures, across the West Bank, displacing more than 4,450 Palestinians."

Heightened Israeli restrictions in terms of physical and administrative barriers, including checkpoints, roadblocks, gates, and permit restrictions, have had an extreme impact on people's access to essential services, employment, and livelihoods. Farmers have been prevented from accessing their land, while direct attacks on their properties have resulted in destruction of crops, irrigation systems and greenhouses. More than 150,000 Palestinian workers from the West Bank used to enter Israel daily for work but had their work permits suspended by Israel after 7 October 2023, leaving those families without sources of income."

Playing FIFA football in settlements is inherently discriminatory, because Palestinian residents of the West Bank cannot access the pitches on which the games take place, which are reserved for Israeli Jews who have been unlawfully transferred into the occupied West Bank.FIFA's Human Rights Policy commits to uphold its responsibilities under the UN Guidelines on Business and Human Rights, which make clear that FIFA has the responsibility not to enable, facilitate, or profit from serious violations of international law. Israeli settlements are illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention and contribute to serious human rights violations.The International Court of Justice ICJ found, in its July 19, 2024 advisory opinion, that Israel's policies and practices in the occupation amounts to apartheid and racial segregation, and that states are obliged to distinguish in all their dealings with Israel between its territory and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, to \"prevent trade or investment relations\" that help maintain the settlements, not to recognize as legal any changes imposed by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory since July 1967, and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation. In 2015, FIFA appointed a special Monitoring Committee to decide on the issue, within a year."

In October 2017, the Council stated its refusal to implement the report's recommendations, claiming that it \"must remain neutral with regard to political matters.\" In May 2024, the Council appointed an ad-hoc legal team to advise it on the matter."

After taking no meaningful action stop clubs from operating in settlements for more than a decade, the FIFA Council should not prolong the harms caused to Palestinians' human rights and to football by deferring the issue yet again for further study by another internal committee.Switzerland, where FIFA is incorporated, \"recognizes the authority of the ICJ and calls on all states to do the same.\" On September 18, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling on Israel and other states to implement the ICJ opinion.The settlement clubs violate FIFA's own rules."

It traces the clear elements of genocide perpetrated by the Israeli army, explores the legal frameworks defining the crime of genocide, and scrutinises both the context and ongoing circumstances. The report also addresses the international judiciary's response, and, significantly, the global community's complicit role in allowing the genocide to continue.Since the start of the genocide in Gaza, more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army, including around 42,000 recorded by the Gaza Ministry of Health, the majority being women and children. In addition, approximately 100,000 have been injured, with thousands of bodies still lying under the rubble and in the streets, unreachable by rescue and medical teams.An estimated 10 per cent of Gaza's population has been killed, injured, reported missing, or detained as a result of Israeli military assaults."

Israel also continued to collect taxes on imports and exports and maintained control over the buffer zone.Following the 7 October 2023 attack, Israel declared a state of war, with its President, Prime Minister, and other political and military leaders at the forefront. The declared aim was to eliminate Hamas, secure the release of hostages, and restore security. Thus began Operation Iron Swords, a brutal military offensive that intensified the suffering of Gaza's civilians.Euro-Med Monitor concluded with a set of recommendations after a year of genocide in Gaza, emphasising that all states, both individually and collectively, are still obligated to work towards stopping the ongoing genocide by all available means."

    "paragraph": "These measures are intended to pressure the responsible parties into upholding international law, ensuring non-recurrence of crimes against Palestinians, and compensating the victims of these atrocities.The organisation further calls for the halting all forms of support to Israel in connection with its genocide and other crimes against Palestinians. This includes withholding investments, cancelling or suspending political, diplomatic, economic, commercial, and academic ties, and curtailing support from the media, legal, and other sectors that might contribute to the continuation of these crimes.Key measures include ensuring the Israeli occupation army's full withdrawal from Gaza, dismantling all military installations, barricades, and checkpoints, ending the imposed military and geographical divisions, restoring the Strip's geographical unity, and guaranteeing the safe and swift return of forcibly displaced individuals to their homes. Furthermore, the recommendations call for the protection of freedom of movement, travel, and access for all citizens of Gaza."

The attack resulted in dozens of casualties, including six fatalities and 57 injuries, with the victims suffering various degrees of wounds, from severe to moderate. The strikes also caused near-total destruction of the power stations, taking them offline almost entirely.According to Mwatana, between 4:50 and 5:00 PM on Sunday, September 29, 2024, Israeli aircraft carried out approximately 20 airstrikes on critical infrastructure in Al-Hudaydah. Eight of these targeted the Al-Hali power station in Al-Hali District, two struck the power station at Al-Hudaydah Port in Al-Mina District, and eight more hit the Al-Kathib station in the As-Salif area of As-Salif District."

Hospitals and healthcare facilities were also affected, with sections like neonatal units and dialysis centers temporarily ceasing operations. The strikes caused widespread panic among city residents and those living near the targeted areas, with fears of a looming fuel crisis prompting citizens in various regions to rush to secure gas and fuel supplies immediately following the attack.Radhya Al-Mutawakel, Chairwoman of Mwatana for Human Rights, stated, \"The Israeli fighter jets' targeting of civilian infrastructure in Yemen underscores their pattern of attacking essential resources for civilians."

    "paragraph": "Since the atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October 2023, killing up to 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages, Israeli forces have pursued an all-out war on people in the Gaza Strip, killing more than 41,500 people , and wounding over 96,000. People have been repeatedly displaced and forced into smaller and smaller areas under bombardments and increasingly inhumane conditions.For a year, Israel, Hamas, and their respective allies have catastrophically failed to reach a deal on a sustained ceasefire in Gaza, while the risk of a full-blown regional conflict is now increasing. Israel must immediately stop the indiscriminate killing of civilians in Gaza and urgently facilitate the delivery of aid to alleviate suffering inside the Strip, including through the reopening of vital border crossings, in compliance with the measures requested by the International Court of Justice.Mdecins Sans Frontires' MSF medical staff have treated patients on a daily basis with wounds caused by massive bombings. People have extensive burns, crushed bones, and have been dismembered."

    "paragraph": "Each time a medical facility is evacuated, thousands of people lose access to lifesaving medical care. This will have consequences on people's health, not just in the immediate term, but in the weeks and months to come.The lack of access to healthcare is compounded by the dearth of enough humanitarian supplies in Gaza. Israeli authorities have routinely imposed unclear, unpredictable criteria for authorising the entry of supplies. Once supplies cross into the Gaza Strip, they often do not make it to their destination, due to an absence of safe and accessible roads, ongoing fighting, and looting of food and basic supply items."

During this period, Israel has committed grave war crimes, with the explicit complicity of the international community.Titled De-Gaza: A Year of Israel's Genocide and the Collapse of World Order, the report details the most prominent crimes committed over the past 12 months, thoroughly documented by Euro-Med field teams. It traces the clear elements of genocide perpetrated by the Israeli army, explores the legal frameworks defining the crime of genocide, and scrutinises both the context and ongoing circumstances. The report also addresses the international judiciary's response, and, significantly, the global community's complicit role in allowing the genocide to continue.An estimated 10 per cent of Gaza's population has been killed, injured, reported missing, or detained as a result of Israeli military assaultThe report sheds light on the appalling conditions and systematic atrocities Israel has inflicted upon the occupied Palestinian territory, with a particular focus on the Gaza Strip."

In addition, approximately 100,000 have been injured, with thousands of bodies still lying under the rubble and in the streets, unreachable by rescue and medical teams.An estimated 10 per cent of Gaza's population has been killed, injured, reported missing, or detained as a result of Israeli military assaults.

However, despite this declaration, Israel continued to exercise control over Gaza, maintaining real authority over critical aspects of governance. The ICJ upheld this position in a recent advisory opinion, reflecting the near-universal international consensus on Israel's continued occupation.Even after its military withdrawal, Israel retained control over the essential governing elements of Gaza, including its population registry, borders land, sea, and air, and the regulation of movement for both people and goods. Israel also continued to collect taxes on imports and exports and maintained control over the buffer zone.Following the 7 October 2023 attack, Israel declared a state of war, with its President, Prime Minister, and other political and military leaders at the forefront."

These measures are intended to pressure the responsible parties into upholding international law, ensuring non-recurrence of crimes against Palestinians, and compensating the victims of these atrocities.The organisation further calls for the halting all forms of support to Israel in connection with its genocide and other crimes against Palestinians. This includes withholding investments, cancelling or suspending political, diplomatic, economic, commercial, and academic ties, and curtailing support from the media, legal, and other sectors that might contribute to the continuation of these crimes.Key measures include ensuring the Israeli occupation army's full withdrawal from Gaza, dismantling all military installations, barricades, and checkpoints, ending the imposed military and geographical divisions, restoring the Strip's geographical unity, and guaranteeing the safe and swift return of forcibly displaced individuals to their homes."

This is an expression of Israel's insistence on committing genocide against Palestinians in the enclave.This destruction is part of a larger Israeli plan that dates back to last October. Under this plan, Israeli forces have worked to eliminate almost 80 of the agricultural land in the Gaza Strip from use by Palestinians. Israel has done this either by isolating it in preparation for its forcible annexation to the so-called \"buffer zone\" or by bulldozing or destroying it by other means, such as bombardmentall of which are in violation of international law.According to the Euro-Med Monitor field team, Israeli forces stormed the area of Al-Shimaa in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, early on Tuesday morning 25 September 2024."

    "paragraph": "Accompanied by military bulldozers, the forces began their bulldozing operations, destroying more than 500 dunums of newly replanted agricultural land, which was supposed to sustain the needs of the people living in northern Gaza, who are subject to an arbitrary siege and systematic starvation by Israel.The Israeli destruction of these agricultural lands, the majority of which were filled with eggplants, reflects Israel's insistence on preventing the Palestinian people from depending on the region's agricultural food basket during a period when sufficient supplies of vegetables and other foods are being kept out of the northern Gaza Strip. This has led to a severe famine, to the point where a significant portion of the people in the north have been forced to eat tree leaves and bake ground-up animal feed instead of flour.Twenty-four-year-old farmer Yousef Saqr Abu Rabie of Beit Lahia told Euro-Med Monitor about the significant losses he incurred on Monday and Tuesday, 23-24 September, as a result of the bulldozing of dozens of dunams north of the town. Abu Rabie stated that although his land is outside of the \"security zone\" established by Israel at the start of the war, the bulldozing operations still occurred, and that the now-bulldozed crops had been bearing fruit that the people of northern Gaza were depending on given Israel's restrictions on the entry of fruits and vegetables into the northern Gazan markets.As part of its crime of genocide, ongoing since 7 October 2023, Israel has worked over the past year to systematically and extensively destroy the Gaza Strip's food basket of fruits, vegetables, and meat, along with all other components of local food production, in addition to blocking the entry of food and humanitarian aid. This has resulted in famine in the Gaza Strip.Israeli forces have bulldozed or otherwise destroyed all agricultural lands along the \"security fence\" separating the eastern and northern Gaza Strip at a depth of nearly two kilometres, removing approximately 96 square kilometres in a clear attempt to annex them to its \"buffer zone\", in violation of international law."

These lands represented the majority of agricultural land in the Gaza Strip and included hundreds of farms built on hundreds of dunams that were planted with vegetables and fruits, as well as hundreds of farms raising poultry and livestock.Outside of this \"buffer zone\", additional land has been destroyed by Israeli incursions or aerial and artillery bombardment, resulting in the destruction of at least 34 square kilometres of agricultural land and the streets that service it. Since the start of the genocide, the Israeli army has also killed several fishermen and destroyed the majority of fishing boats and fishing ports in the Gaza Strip. Additionally, the lack of electricity, destruction of water wells, and scarcity of fuel all make it difficult to cultivate new areas and irrigate them with water."

These effects compound over time, and at some point, may result in startling increases in the death rate.The internationally recognised human right to food, water, and sanitation is a basic right that protects population health and dignity. It can only be realised if the international community puts an end to Israel's crime of genocide; removes the illegal blockade on the Gaza Strip; and salvages what remains of the besieged enclave, which is currently uninhabitable on all fronts. Delays will cause the Strip to deteriorate further, cost more civilian lives, and heavily affect people's health outcomes.The international community must act swiftly and forcefully to end to Israel's crime of genocide in the Gaza Strip, which involves both the direct killing of, and the imposition of unbearable living conditions on, the Palestinian people there."

Moreover, severe damage to the agri-food economy has compounded the humanitarian crisis and devastated livelihoods; prior to 2020, 13 per cent of Gaza's workforce were employed in the agricultural sector that also offered informal employment to over 90 percent of the population.

In particular, partners continue to face major security and access constraints in reaching medical facilities in northern Gaza, which is also impeding fuel deliveries and forcing all healthcare facilities in the north to ration fuel supplies and interrupt some services.- The lack of a systematic mechanism for the medical evacuation of critically ill and injured patients out of Gaza results in an ever-growing waiting list. In a joint assessment published on 25 September, the Health and WASH Clusters warned that many IDP sites are assessed to be located in or near flooding hotspots and additional locations are vulnerable to flooding at present.NutritionResponse- The Cluster has trained 17 analysts for the upcoming Integrated Phase Classification for acute malnutrition IPC-AMN exercise, with the support of the IPC Global Support Unit.

The latest satellite imagery collected by UNOSAT in September 2024 shows that approximately 68 per cent 102 square kilometres of permanent crop fields in Gaza exhibit a significant decline in health and density, compared with the average of the previous seven years.- While the olive harvest season in Gaza has started, there is sharp decrease in olive production due to mass destruction of olive orchards, with more than one million olive trees uprooted since the escalation of hostilities in October 2023. Only four out of 37 olive presses remain functional throughout the Strip, but challenging access to fuel represents a key obstacle hampering the use of even this remaining equipment.- The significant increase in firewood prices continues to push an increasing number of people into energy poverty, exacerbated by the limited availability of gas and the ongoing electricity cuts. It is anticipated that the energy crisis will further worsen as the rainy winter season approaches."

    "paragraph": "In the north, the lack of entry of cooking gas has entered its 12th consecutive month. Protracted shortages of energy sources for cooking continue to force displaced families to cook by burning wood from waste, which hinders proper food preparation and nutrition intake, exacerbates health and protection risks, and causes environmental hazards.- The extremely limited entry of fertilizers and other livestock and crop production inputs is a key obstacle hampering the restoration of local food production in Gaza. A dual-track approach is required to food assistance and emergency livelihood interventions. This includes 78,600 cubic metres of water produced by municipal and UNRWA water wells.- Between 21 and 27 September, WASH Cluster partners received a total of 123,164 litres of fuel, or an average of 17,500 litres per day, which represents only 25 per cent of the minimum daily requirement of 70,000 litres to meet critical WASH and public health needs."

Health-care facilities are also struggling to maintain proper sanitation, increasing the risk of infections for patients and staff.- The flow of water from the main transmission line running from Israel remains at only 80 per cent of capacity, with several critical water facilities damaged and rendered inaccessible in recent weeks. Water supply through the middle and southern connection points must be urgently increased to full capacity.Shelter and Non-Food Items NFIResponse- The Shelter Cluster continues to track the needs of internally displaced persons IDPs whose shelters have been damaged by hostilities or flooded. Recently, two Cluster partners assessed a displacement site west of Al-Rasheed Street, on the Costal Road, to identify households most vulnerable to tidal impacts during the winter season and assess necessary shelter assistance.- Despite supply shortages, and where possible, the Cluster provides shelter support, including tents, sealing-off kits and non-food items."

Tents and a limited quantity of sealing-off kits were also provided to households in northern Gaza.Challenges- Shelter Cluster partners continue to face challenges in importing shelter materials, which is deeply concerning as the winter season approaches. The Cluster has been forced to prioritise the bare minimum of shelter items, which would not constitute dignified shelter. This means that, even if these minimum supplies are brought in, affected households will not be adequately protected in the winter.- A shortage of shelter items could lead to increased health risks, potential fatalities, and even protests."

    "paragraph": "In September, cluster partners received only nine trucks of shelter items via the Fence Road, which is currently the main route for these supplies. Without access to undertake assessments, capacity to conduct repairs, or anywhere else for families to go, the cluster is not able to practically support those in damaged buildings other than alerting them of the risks through awareness-raising messages.Site Management Working Group SMWGResponse- During the reporting period, SMWG partners monitored 38 sites hosting approximately 170,875 people in the Khan Younis, Deir al Balah, Gaza and North Gaza governorates. EPRs have been mobilized in the majority of inter-cluster assessments to support, along with Protection Cluster staff, the conduct of key informant interviews, facilitate focus group discussions at the community level, and refer protection cases as needed to specialized Protection partners or to other clusters.- While 12 GBV partners were able to distribute 1,900 dignity kits in Deir al Balah and Khan Younis, this is far below the scale of needs, with over 800,000 dignity kits estimated to be required at present. The dramatic spike in prices and the irregular availability of hygiene supplies on the market leave many women and girls with no means to cope with this gap, with dire shortages of blankets, shoes, warm clothes and other winter items expected to soon exacerbate their suffering."

Partners are also working with the Shelter Cluster to develop a referral protocol to mitigate the risk of exploitation of vulnerable cases.- The Child Protection Case Management Working Group, in cooperation with Save the Children, began conducting surveys and key informant interviews with case managers to assess needs and address gaps in the current management of child protection cases. Moreover, jointly with UNRWA, Child Protection partners began data collection to plan for winterization activities; this includes procuring psychosocial support kits and winter clothes through the private sector.- Mine Action partners continue to use SMS, radio, and social media to disseminate messages on explosive ordnance risk education and conflict preparedness and protection EORE-CPP. Between 14 and 27 September, partners completed 13 explosive hazard assessments EHAs and took part in five inter agency missions.- UNRWA's protection teams continue to identify and respond to protection risks and the needs of displaced people in Khan Younis and Deir al Balah, including Al Mawasi."

With the Education Cluster, Protection Monitors also continue to closely monitor learning activities in shelters to ensure that the safety, dignity, and wellbeing of children are prioritised, and any protection issue or concern is timely addressed.Challenges- Insecurity, the disruption of aid flows, the breakdown of law and order, and the denial or restriction on entry of critical items by the Israeli authorities continue to hinder the Protection response. These items include sanitary pads, dignity, and menstrual hygiene management kits MHM for women and girls, recreational materials for children and assistive devices for persons with disabilities. Minimum standard explosive ordnance disposal EOD equipment and EORE materials are also prevented entry by Israeli authorities into Gaza, thereby limiting the capacity of the Mine Action response.- IDP sites are in dire condition, amid the continued spread of skin diseases and an acute lack of medications."

    "paragraph": "For example, sites visited by UNRWA protection monitors in Al Mawasi are characterized by worn out tents and tarpaulins, lack of mattresses, key NFIs, and insufficient food, water and sanitation. The approaching adverse weather conditions represent a key concern. IDPs are deeply distressed about the lack of assistance and are demanding support.- The shortage of tents affects the ability to expand group-based psycho-social support and provide safe spaces or temporary accommodation for unaccompanied children. The limited availability of supplies on the local market, including MHM and dignity kits, has disproportionately affected women and girls, who are at risk of GBV, and increased their vulnerability to disease."

    "paragraph": "The PSS needs remain vast, and it is critical that more kits be approved for entry into the Strip.- While the Child Protection sub-cluster and UNICEF are endeavoring to reunify unaccompanied and separated children with their parents and families, barriers include frequent denial of missions. Currently, at least 60 children have been identified by UNICEF and UNRWA who require reunification with their families.- Lack of funding and impeded access by Israeli authorities for specialized personnel and equipment for the clearance and disposal of deep-buried bombs DBB hamper people's protection from explosive remnants of war ERW and the safe and sustainable delivery of humanitarian aid. Mine Action stresses the need to obtain meaningful data from the Israeli authorities regarding the geographical location of ERW and hazardous areas.- The ongoing power cuts and limited access to communications services, coupled with fuel shortages and damage to key infrastructure, continue to curtail mobility. Insecurity, bombardments and ensuing displacement continue to constrain community outreach and protection activities, including proper case management for GBV and child protection.- Cash shortages continue to hinder the use of Cash and Voucher Assistance CVA by some recipients, negatively affecting living conditions, increasing the risk of exposure to violence or exploitation for women and girls, and undermining the ability of partners to pay local service providers and staff salaries."

To date, a total of 215 TLSs serving nearly 34,000 children have been set up across the Strip, in which school-aged children participate in informal learning focused on essential literacy and numeracy skill and receive mental health and psychosocial support MHPSS to help them cope with and recover from traumatic experiences.- There has also been a notable increase in community-led education initiatives, with over 25 new initiatives reported to the Cluster during the reporting period. This rise reflects the communities' continued demand for and prioritization of education. Cluster partners are actively engaging with these communities to provide support, aiming to expand coverage and enhance the quality of services offered.Challenges- The entry of education supplies continues to be restricted, with the latest denial of shipments of prefabricated structures essential for creating temporary learning spaces."

    "paragraph": "As winter approaches, these supplies are crucial for enhancing these spaces; without them, access to education during peak winter will be nearly impossible.- According to geospatial analysis by the Education Cluster, eight TLSs serving 887 students are directly located within flood-prone areas, another 24 TLSs benefiting nearly 5,800 students are less than 100 metres away from such areas, and an additional 14 TLSs serving almost 3,000 students are within 100 metres from the coastline. These spaces are expected to face flooding and become inaccessible during the rainy season, with restrictions on the entry of winterproof tents hampering the implementation of crucial mitigation measures.- The continued targeting of schools is further destroying educational infrastructure and instilling fear in parents and children, hindering participation in temporary learning activities. In September alone, 17 instances of airstrikes by the Israeli military on schools were reported, including 10 incidents in the Gaza and North Gaza governorates. These include at least 14 schools that were hosting IDPs, of which seven are operated by UNRWA.- As of 1 October, according to the Ministry of Education, 10,449 students and 419 educational staff have been killed in Gaza, while over 16,250 students and 2,463 teachers have been injured since the escalation of hostilities on 7 October."

Protracted shortages of energy sources for cooking continue to force displaced families to cook by burning wood from waste, which hinders proper food preparation and nutrition intake, exacerbates health and protection risks, and causes environmental hazards.The extremely limited entry of fertilizers and other livestock and crop production inputs is a key obstacle hampering the restoration of local food production in Gaza."

This includes 78,600 cubic metres of water produced by municipal and UNRWA water wells.Between 21 and 27 September, WASH Cluster partners received a total of 123,164 litres of fuel, or an average of 17,500 litres per day, which represents only 25 per cent of the minimum daily requirement of 70,000 litres to meet critical WASH and public health needs. Key products like shampoo, detergent, and dishwashing liquid are no longer available, making it impossible for households to maintain cleanliness, prepare food safely, or wash clothes. Health-care facilities are also struggling to maintain proper sanitation, increasing the risk of infections for patients and staff.The flow of water from the main transmission line running from Israel remains at only 80 per cent of capacity, with several critical water facilities damaged and rendered inaccessible in recent weeks."

Recently, two Cluster partners assessed a displacement site west of Al-Rasheed Street, on the Costal Road, to identify households most vulnerable to tidal impacts during the winter season and assess necessary shelter assistance.Despite supply shortages, and where possible, the Cluster provides shelter support, including tents, sealing-off kits and non-food items. Between 16 and 29 September, Cluster partners distributed 620 family tents and 3,300 pieces of tarpaulin to households in need in southern Gaza. Tents and a limited quantity of sealing-off kits were also provided to households in northern Gaza.---ChallengesShelter Cluster partners continue to face challenges in importing shelter materials, which is deeply concerning as the winter season approaches."

    "paragraph": "The Cluster has been forced to prioritise the bare minimum of shelter items, which would not constitute dignified shelter. This means that, even if these minimum supplies are brought in, affected households will not be adequately protected in the winter.A shortage of shelter items could lead to increased health risks, potential fatalities, and even protests. In September, cluster partners received only nine trucks of shelter items via the Fence Road, which is currently the main route for these supplies. Without access to undertake assessments, capacity to conduct repairs, or anywhere else for families to go, the cluster is not able to practically support those in damaged buildings other than alerting them of the risks through awareness-raising messages.Site Management Working Group SMWG ResponseDuring the reporting period, SMWG partners monitored 38 sites hosting approximately 170,875 people in the Khan Younis, Deir al Balah, Gaza and North Gaza governorates."

The dramatic spike in prices and the irregular availability of hygiene supplies on the market leave many women and girls with no means to cope with this gap, with dire shortages of blankets, shoes, warm clothes and other winter items expected to soon exacerbate their suffering. The GBV sub-cluster is assessing the potential for cash assistance to address the urgent needs of women and girls, but the unavailability of cash in Gaza continues to be hinder support.Jointly with the Mental Health and Psychosocial Support MHPSS Technical Working Group, there are ongoing efforts to strengthen MHPSS services for women and girls at risk of GBV, including those with disabilities, and increase the capacity of GBV frontline workers to provide support and align their service provision with GBV Minimum Standards. Partners are also working with the Shelter Cluster to develop a referral protocol to mitigate the risk of exploitation of vulnerable cases.The Child Protection Case Management Working Group, in cooperation with Save the Children, began conducting surveys and key informant interviews with case managers to assess needs and address gaps in the current management of child protection cases."

These items include sanitary pads, dignity, and menstrual hygiene management kits MHM for women and girls, recreational materials for children and assistive devices for persons with disabilities. Minimum standard explosive ordnance disposal EOD equipment and EORE materials are also prevented entry by Israeli authorities into Gaza, thereby limiting the capacity of the Mine Action response.IDP sites are in dire condition, amid the continued spread of skin diseases and an acute lack of medications."

The approaching adverse weather conditions represent a key concern. IDPs are deeply distressed about the lack of assistance and are demanding support.The shortage of tents affects the ability to expand group-based psycho-social support and provide safe spaces or temporary accommodation for unaccompanied children. The limited availability of supplies on the local market, including MHM and dignity kits, has disproportionately affected women and girls, who are at risk of GBV, and increased their vulnerability to disease."

To date, a total of 215 TLSs serving nearly 34,000 children have been set up across the Strip, in which school-aged children participate in informal learning focused on essential literacy and numeracy skill and receive mental health and psychosocial support MHPSS to help them cope with and recover from traumatic experiences.There has also been a notable increase in community-led education initiatives, with over 25 new initiatives reported to the Cluster during the reporting period. This rise reflects the communities' continued demand for and prioritization of education. Cluster partners are actively engaging with these communities to provide support, aiming to expand coverage and enhance the quality of services offered.ChallengesThe entry of education supplies continues to be restricted, with the latest denial of shipments of prefabricated structures essential for creating temporary learning spaces."

These spaces are expected to face flooding and become inaccessible during the rainy season, with restrictions on the entry of winterproof tents hampering the implementation of crucial mitigation measures.The continued targeting of schools is further destroying educational infrastructure and instilling fear in parents and children, hindering participation in temporary learning activities. In September alone, 17 instances of airstrikes by the Israeli military on schools were reported, including 10 incidents in the Gaza and North Gaza governorates. These include at least 14 schools that were hosting IDPs, of which seven are operated by UNRWA.As of 1 October, according to the Ministry of Education, 10,449 students and 419 educational staff have been killed in Gaza, while over 16,250 students and 2,463 teachers have been injured since the escalation of hostilities on 7 October."
