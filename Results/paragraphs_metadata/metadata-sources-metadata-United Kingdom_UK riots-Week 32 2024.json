    "paragraph": "title: The Guardian view on the riots: culpability in high places  content: The weekend scenes of encircled mosques guarded by police, and hotels accommodating asylum seekers attacked by mobs intent on violence, were among the most disturbing seen on British streets for many years. In their scope and intensity, these riots were of a different order to relatively isolated incidents in the past, such as the petrol bomb attack on a Dover immigration centre in 2022. In Rotherham, where a group of rioters broke into a Holiday Inn and attempted to set the building on fire, the bravery of outnumbered police averted a potential tragedy.Responsibility for this horror naturally lies with the perpetrators, who exploited the tragic murder of three girls in Southport last week as a convenient pretext for xenophobic violence. It is, as Sir Keir Starmer clearly intends, imperative that they are swiftly seen to suffer the consequences of such thuggery in court.It will not, however, be sufficient to address these events primarily through the legal lens of violent disorder and criminality."

These actions were a challenge to Britain's peaceful multi-ethnic identity.As Dame Sara Khan, the independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience under Rishi Sunak, told this newspaper, that did not come about in a political vacuum. According to Ms Khan's own research, the inflammatory rhetoric deployed by successive Conservative governments in relation to immigration has palpably nourished extremism on the ground."

Just as importantly, the mainstreaming and normalisation of far-right discourse on immigration in Britain, as elsewhere in Europe, is a political fact that requires a response. The reality of Britain as a multicultural society needs to be defended and celebrated, both rhetorically and through the provision of real resources and support to challenged areas.As has been said many times in the aftermath of Southport, the overwhelming majority of Britons will view the events of the past few days with utter revulsion."

Chants of \"Tommy Robinson\" and, to the disdain of other local people, \"Yorkshire\" could be heard from people who said they \"want our country back\".

This is not helpful to understanding why it occurred and how to prevent future disorder. The government needs to commission a proper inquiry into who instigated it, who took part and the underlying causes.The review must look at the role that far-right ideology and organisation played, including the spread of misinformation online. The far right has long exploited the issue of asylum hotels, as highlighted in a 2024 review by the government's social cohesion adviser, Sara Khan; in 2023, protests outside a Merseyside hotel used to house asylum seekers turned into violent clashes with the police."

The latter is about helping new arrivals to integrate into British life.Too much commentary in recent days has loosely attributed the riots to poor levels of integration; in fact, the UK performs relatively well on certain measures of integration, with sustained intergenerational falls in levels of prejudice, gradual decreases in levels of residential segregation, and second-generation immigrant children outperforming non-immigrant children at school. Despite several reports on community cohesion since 2000, the government does not have a framework with which to measure it nor an evidence base on what works. There are examples of incidents flaring up and being dealt with very poorly by local authorities; for example, the appalling treatment of the teacher in Batley, West Yorkshire, forced to go into hiding after he taught a lesson on free speech and blasphemy that included images of the prophet Muhammad.Finally, community cohesion is inevitably undermined by economic hardship."

There are legitimate debates to be had about the right levels of immigration and how asylum should work; what is illegitimate is pretending that immigration is responsible for the underfunding of the NHS, or a lack of school places, or the high cost of housing, when they are overwhelmingly the product of political choices.The worst of the unrest is hopefully behind us. But what has played out over the past two weeks serves as a reminder that we cannot take a healthy, pluralistic and tolerant society for granted; it is something that political leaders must learn to nurture.-Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?"

While activists affiliated with traditional far-right organisations have been involved, most of these protests were planned organically, often by local people, who are plugged into decentralised far-right networks online.The shared slogans, language and iconography don't show that these rioters form a cohesive or coordinated group; rather, it means that their organisers and attenders are often active in overlapping online spaces. Though not centrally organised, the participants are drawing from a common wellspring of anger and often recycle the same slogans  in particular \"enough is enough\", \"stop the boats\" and \"save our children\".Modern technology, and social media in particular, enables individuals to collaborate towards common political goals independent of traditional organisational structures."

It was no surprise that his name was regularly chanted by rioters at most of this week's protests as they hurled bricks at mosques and screamed racist slogans.That this wave of violence was organised across a range of social media platforms is further proof that what happens online has a real effect in our communities and on our streets.

Not only were those 20th-century protesters facing exactly what a massive and angry Deptford unemployed march of 1886 had also encountered from the police as they also tried to cross the Thames, they were echoing the long distant battle that occurred as Jack Cade's Kentish rebels fought their way across London Bridge in 1450.The riots of 2024 are very different.

A number of the far right protests have involved racist or Islamaphobic chants, with some participants seen making Nazi salutes, while black and Asian people have been attacked in broad daylight.Responding to the police response to the disorder, Mr Farage said: \"The impression of two-tier policing has become widespread\", adding: \"The Prime Minister's faltering attempts to address the current crisis have only added to that sense of injustice. \"The term two-tier policing', often spread by far-right conspiracists and now being peddled by Elon Musk on Twitter, refers to how police handle different groups in society. Which is really Islamaphobic and racist movements that are causing destruction up and down the country."

In many cases, their posts are eagerly shared and viewed by the far-right foot soldiers who joined the weekend's riots  even if the authors quietly condemn violence after the fact.Tommy Robinson, the figurehead of Britain's far right, was reinstated to X then Twitter days after Elon Musk bought the platform. Amid the weekend's riots, Fox told his followers: \"Islam needs to be removed from Britain. Courts stayed open 24 hours and sentences were well publicized, in an effort not just to deal justice but to send a message.He has reached for the same playbook this week."

Outbreaks of lawlessness and violence that were in large part a response to racial targeting by the police: harassment that aggravated existing disadvantages and intensified deep disillusionment, especially among the younger generation who had been born in Britain.However, a very different set of events with a far longer history has also been defined as race riots."

The grievance that brought them on to the streets was the presence in their cities of non-white people. We must now add the summer of 2024 to the list of riots that were in essence organised violence against minority communities. My generation, brought up amid the endemic racism of the 1980s, had in recent years started to believe that our memories of being assaulted on the streets or besieged in our homes belonged firmly to a 20th-century Britain that we had long ago left behind."

The initial category error, made by much of the media, was to describe riots as protests. That misstep led to later difficulties.

While there were horrific attacks on hotels housing asylum seekers, most of those targeted by the rioters were British citizens: members of communities with histories that go back three generations or more. When the mobs in Rotherham launched their sickening assault on a hotel, the racial slur spray-painted on to that hotel's walls was the P-word, aimed not at asylum seekers but squarely at the established British Muslim community.Riots are not protests and there is a difference between motivations and excuses. Despite much that has been said, the riots of 2024 were not born of \"legitimate grievances\" about poverty, underinvestment and the breakdown of basic services, all supposedly deepened by mass immigration."

But those bleak realities are the result of long-term political choices, not asylum seekers huddled terrified in hotels.The ideological fanaticism of the Thatcher government that limited the ability of local authorities to use income generated from the sale of council houses to build new properties, the ideologically driven impoverishment of local government by the Cameron-Osborne government and the self-inflicted wound of Brexit: these and other factors are what lie behind the shocking lack of access to basic resources  social housing, doctor's appointments and dental surgeries. Immigration, rather than worsening that situation, is one of the few levers we have to increase access to medical care. Skilled immigration will also be needed if we are to build the millions of homes needed.To put the violence directed at British Muslims, Black Britons and asylum seeking down to \"legitimate grievances\" is to fall for one of the most toxic and intentionally divisive falsehoods in the populist handbook: the myth that class and race are diametrically opposed, the assertion that non-white people have no class identity."

Dozens of police battling to protect the people have been injured, some very seriously with broken bones.Most Zimbabweans will remember a dreadful tragedy here, when a Chitungwiza security guard was brutally murdered and her body hacked up by a former boyfriend, and people using social media to spread lies that her kidnapping and murder were politically organised. Those lies sparked violence and looting in Nyatsime.In the UK, 428 men have so far been arrested, and the courts are not messing around with bail. Those arrested for violence and incitement are remanded in custody when they are brought to court.Those faced with overwhelming evidence and pleading guilty have a very early trial, jumping the backlog queue, and already the first jail terms are being dished out, with the most severe for three years."
