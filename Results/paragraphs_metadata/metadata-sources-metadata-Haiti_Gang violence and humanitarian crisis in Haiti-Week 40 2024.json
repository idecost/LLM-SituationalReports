    "paragraph": "Around 94 percent of women and girls are at risk of GBV and almost three-quarters 72 percent of GBV incidents are sexual violence.UNFPA and its implementing partners continue to provide sexual and reproductive health SRH and GBV services where access is possible and security allows. This includes deploying mobile teams to IDP sites to provide integrated SRHGBV services; the provision of remote psychosocial support, referrals, case documentation and GBV information via a hotline; and awareness raising activities on GBV and SRH and available services. UNFPA continues to support the GBV coordination mechanism at the national level and in Artibonite, in close collaboration with the Ministry on the Status and Rights of Women.Situation OverviewGang violence continues to drive displacement, including in Cit Soleil, Ganthier and Bas-Delmas. More than 700,000 persons are internally displaced across the country."

    "paragraph": "Women and girls are particularly affected by the crisis  the risks of sexual violence in displacement sites has risen, in part, due to the poor living conditions.Criminal incidents, including armed robberies, burglaries and kidnappings, have recently increased in Haiti, particularly in MAPAP . Factors for tensions include a lack of resources, access to food, water and the high prices of products on the market since the arrival of IDPs. Access to land was also mentioned, especially in provinces.---Despite an improvement in the security situation, humanitarian access remains a challenge and is impacting service provision in areas where there are risks of attacks and abductions. Improving security conditions is the first factor reported by households who are considering returning home: 84 of households in IDP sites and 77 of households in host communities.Although more than 5 million people, roughly half the population, are going hungry and hundreds of thousands have been displaced, a 674 humanitarian appeal for Haiti has received just over a third 36 percent of the funding."

In the capital city of Port-au-Prince, gangs are committing extreme acts of violence that are directly and indirectly affecting citizens. Many citizens have fled areas where gangs have taken over, leaving many displaced from their homes and in urgent need of humanitarian aid.

A year later, by the end of 2023, the situation had reversed, with the majority of IDPs residing in sites 58."

    "paragraph": "This trend continued in 2024 and currently, more than 6 out of 10 IDPs reside in sites 63 see Figure 17.The growing insecurity restricting possibilities to seek refuge with relatives, the lack of resources of host families to accommodate IDPs for a relatively long period of time, and the deterioration of social cohesion, are the main reasons for this. Surveys carried out by the DTM among displaced households and host communities in the country have shown that tensions and conflicts between IDPs and host communities are more frequent in the MAPAP than in the provinces.IDPs in sites represent the category of households that most often reports the existence of tensions or conflicts with host communities.

IDPs' hosting locations in the Great Southsitessame as in round 7The number of IDPs in the four departments of the Great South increased by 17 compared to Round 7. This increase is due to the displacement of people who fled the municipality of Gressier, which has become, along with Port-au-Prince, the main place of origin for IDPs in the Great South, particularly those living in the Southeast see Figures 34 and 35.This region is the leading host region for IDPs in the country, hosting nearly half of the country's IDPs 45."
