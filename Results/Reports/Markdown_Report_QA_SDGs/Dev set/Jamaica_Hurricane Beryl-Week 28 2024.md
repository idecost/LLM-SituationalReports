# Jamaica_Hurricane Beryl-Week 28 2024

## Summary
Jamaica is facing widespread destruction and significant humanitarian needs after Hurricane Beryl made landfall as a Category 5 storm on July 3rd[32]. Southern coastal areas, including parishes like St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, Manchester, Westmoreland, and Hanover, were most severely impacted, suffering extensive damage to telecommunications, water, electricity, health infrastructure, housing, public buildings, agriculture, and fishing livelihoods[54]. Many communities remain without access to clean water, sanitation, and electricity, with 70% of National Water Commission customers initially without water and power restoration in the worst areas projected to take four to eight weeks[43]. Two deaths have been confirmed, and approximately 1,876 people, including 113 children, are in shelters[20]. In response, the Government of Jamaica declared a disaster area and launched the Relief Emergency Assistance and Community Help (REACH) program for recovery, focusing on distributing food and essential supplies, restoring utilities, and supporting housing and economic recovery, while formally accepting support from the United Nations[62]. The UN, through its Resident Coordinator and the activated UN Emergency Technical Team (UNETT), which is co-shared by UNICEF and WFP, has deployed UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) teams for joint assessments and is coordinating international assistance, including a US$4 million allocation from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) for Jamaica and other affected Caribbean nations[62]. Agencies like UNICEF are providing prepositioned water, hygiene, and dignity supplies, and planning for disease prevention, psycho-social support, and cash transfers, while FAO is conducting damage assessments using advanced technology to aid agricultural recovery[36]. Humanitarian access and communication remain challenging in affected areas, hindering aid delivery and assessment efforts[25].

## SDG 1 - No Poverty

**Question:**  How is the United Way of Jamaica (UWJ) mobilizing resources through the Farmer's Rehabilitation Fund (FRF) to support farmers in the parishes of Clarendon, St Elizabeth, and Manchester, and what specific resources are being provided?
**Answer:** The United Way of Jamaica (UWJ) launched a Farmer's Rehabilitation Fund (FRF) with the aim of raising up to 20 million to provide immediate and long-term support to affected farming communities [2]. The UWJ aims to mobilize resources and provide financial support to farmers, specifically in the parishes of Clarendon, St Elizabeth, and Manchester, who were more severely impacted by Hurricane Beryl [2]. Seprod and Musson Foundations committed to donating 2 million to the rehabilitation fund [3]. The UWJ urges private and public organizations to collaborate to strengthen its efforts to provide effective assistance through the FRF initiative [4]. The FRF will facilitate access to critical resources including seeds, equipment, and financial aid to help farmers restore their livelihood [2][4].

**Question:**  What are the estimated financial damages to Jamaica's agricultural sector due to Hurricane Beryl, and how do these damages affect food security and livelihoods on the island?
**Answer:** The provided sources do not specify the estimated financial damages to Jamaica's agricultural sector due to Hurricane Beryl. However, authorities estimate over US$6.4 million in damage to the agricultural sector in affected countries [1].

These damages have severe effects on agriculture, threatening food security and the livelihoods of small producers [2]. Damaged crops include vegetables and fruits, which are sources of food on the island [1][7]. The livestock and fisheries sectors have also experienced considerable damage [1][7], including loss of fishing capacity, damage to vessels, support infrastructure, and fishing equipment [2]. The overall devastation has led to crop and infrastructure damage, livestock losses, soil erosion, and economic challenges for farmers [3]. These impacts raise concerns about food security and livelihoods [1][7], affecting citizens' access to food in their families and communities [3], and impacting everyone dependent on agriculture down the supply chain in Jamaica [5].

**Question:**  What specific measures are being implemented to address the obstruction of access due to ongoing rains and debris in Jamaica, and how are these affecting aid delivery and assessments?
**Answer:** Ongoing rains and debris are obstructing access in Jamaica, delaying aid delivery and assessments [1]. Humanitarian access is also challenged by flooding, debris from fallen trees, landslides, and infrastructural damage [6]. To address this, recovery efforts include "debushing and the carting away of debris" and "cleaning and desilting of drains" [7]. The chief of defence staff has been instructed to mobilize the Disaster Assistance and Recovery Team and other supporting units, including engineers, to assist with rebuilding and recovery in areas with the greatest damage, such as Rocky Point and Portland Cottage [2]. Social workers are conducting daily assessments and providing support, including mattresses, food packages, and tarpaulins, to impacted residents [7].

**Question:**  How is the REACH (Relief Emergency Assistance and Community Help) programme structured to ensure the equitable distribution of food and essential supplies in the most affected areas of Jamaica?
**Answer:** The REACH (Relief Emergency Assistance and Community Help) programme includes the distribution of food and essential supplies as one of its main elements [1]. The government is coordinating the continued distribution of food, water, medical sundries, and other essentials to citizens in the most affected areas [1].

To ensure equitable distribution, the Prime Minister stated that the process for determining who is assisted must be "absolutely transparent" to prevent favoritism [2]. He is developing a system that integrates past experiences and technology to properly identify "the needy beneficiary and not the greedy person" [2]. This relief is intended to be non-partisan and transparent [2][5], with distribution carried out by all members of parliament in a non-partisan way, emphasizing "there is no colour or affiliation in a disaster" [5]. The process relies on assessments from entities such as the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM), utilities, and public infrastructure [5]. Support is provided to communities where damage is greatest, such as Rocky Point and Portland Cottage [5].

However, the provided sources do not specify what particular emergency shelter materials or types of relocation assistance are being prioritized.

**Question:**  What specific measures are being implemented to ensure that the additional 4 million allocated for roofing replacement in Jamaica reaches the intended beneficiaries, and how will accountability be maintained?
**Answer:** The additional 4 million allocated for roofing replacement will be focused largely on helping persons replace their roofing [3]. To ensure accountability, Members of Parliament were cautioned that "everyone who receives a benefit must sign for it" [3].

**Question:**  How are non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and volunteers collaborating with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security in Jamaica to provide immediate relief and conduct damage assessments following Hurricane Beryl?
**Answer:** The Ministry of Labour and Social Security is committed to leaving no one behind and encourages all Jamaicans, particularly those in a better position, to join in the work of rebuilding the nation [2]. Teams from other ministries, including local government and community development, education and youth, and health and wellness, along with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Red Cross and Food for the Poor, have been working alongside the Labour Ministry [3]. These teams are going house to house to promptly deploy islandwide, deliver immediate relief supplies, and conduct initial damage assessments [3]. The relief outreach is also being done with the aid of several NGOs, other partners, and volunteers [4]. Jamaicans are encouraged to volunteer, get out of their houses, and donate supplies [2]. Community members have also assisted with managing shelters [9] and fixing damaged roofs [12].

**Question:**  How is Appliance Traders Ltd (ATL) addressing the increased demand for power generators in Jamaica following Hurricane Beryl, and what challenges have they faced in meeting this demand?
**Answer:** Appliance Traders Ltd (ATL) is addressing the increased demand for power generators by having more units "on the way" [1]. The challenge they faced was that the smaller, portable power supply products were "snatched up" before Hurricane Beryl even arrived [1]. Customers began purchasing these generators as soon as Hurricane Beryl was named and tracked to be in Jamaica's direct line of sight [1].

**Question:**  What measures are being taken by ATL to ensure an adequate supply of generators in Jamaica during the hurricane season, given the increased demand and potential supply chain delays?
**Answer:** ATL is taking several measures to ensure an adequate supply of generators in Jamaica during the hurricane season. They have ordered more generators to come in for the five-month hurricane season [2]. ATL also plans to adjust by having more than one container of generators arrive in stock and be dispatched to various locations well ahead of time, anticipating potential changes in weather patterns and an earlier season next year [2]. Furthermore, ATL assures the public that they will not increase prices during the hurricane season to protect their customers [1][4]. They intend to apply the same principle as for air conditioning units, putting generators on sale when demand is greater, without increasing prices above their normal rates [4].

**Question:**  How is the anticipated increase in generator prices, due to factors such as demand and currency fluctuations, expected to impact the availability and affordability of generators in Jamaica post-Hurricane Beryl?
**Answer:** New generator stock from suppliers in China is expected to take approximately two months to reach Jamaica and will not have the same price as pre-Hurricane Beryl, with prices anticipated to "definitely increase" due to variables such as demand and the dollar [1]. However, ATL's Crichton assured the public that ATL will not increase any prices during the hurricane season to protect customers [1]. Another source also stated that prices would not increase above what they would have normally been priced at, and that generators might be put on sale when demand is greater, similar to air conditioning units [3]. Regarding availability, there was limited stock, with only 10 units sold on Monday and 11 on Tuesday [1]. Due to high demand from all three branches, it may not be possible to supply everyone's needs [4], although more generators have been ordered [4].

## SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth

**Question:**  How is the United Way of Jamaica (UWJ) mobilizing resources through the Farmer's Rehabilitation Fund (FRF) to support farmers in the parishes of Clarendon, St Elizabeth, and Manchester, and what specific resources are being provided?
**Answer:** The United Way of Jamaica (UWJ) launched a Farmer's Rehabilitation Fund (FRF) with the aim of raising up to 20 million to provide immediate and long-term support to affected farming communities [2]. The UWJ aims to mobilize resources and provide financial support to farmers, specifically in the parishes of Clarendon, St Elizabeth, and Manchester, who were more severely impacted by Hurricane Beryl [2]. Seprod and Musson Foundations committed to donating 2 million to the rehabilitation fund [3]. The UWJ urges private and public organizations to collaborate to strengthen its efforts to provide effective assistance through the FRF initiative [4]. The FRF will facilitate access to critical resources including seeds, equipment, and financial aid to help farmers restore their livelihood [2][4].

**Question:**  What are the estimated financial damages to Jamaica's agricultural sector due to Hurricane Beryl, and how do these damages affect food security and livelihoods on the island?
**Answer:** The provided sources do not specify the estimated financial damages to Jamaica's agricultural sector due to Hurricane Beryl. However, authorities estimate over US$6.4 million in damage to the agricultural sector in affected countries [1].

These damages have severe effects on agriculture, threatening food security and the livelihoods of small producers [2]. Damaged crops include vegetables and fruits, which are sources of food on the island [1][7]. The livestock and fisheries sectors have also experienced considerable damage [1][7], including loss of fishing capacity, damage to vessels, support infrastructure, and fishing equipment [2]. The overall devastation has led to crop and infrastructure damage, livestock losses, soil erosion, and economic challenges for farmers [3]. These impacts raise concerns about food security and livelihoods [1][7], affecting citizens' access to food in their families and communities [3], and impacting everyone dependent on agriculture down the supply chain in Jamaica [5].

**Question:**  How is the Ministry of Labour and Social Security in Jamaica encouraging public participation in the rebuilding efforts, and what specific actions are being taken to ensure no one is left behind in the recovery process?
**Answer:** The Ministry of Labour and Social Security is committed to leaving no one behind and encourages all Jamaicans, particularly those in a better position, to join in the work of rebuilding the nation [1]. They urge individuals to assist by reaching out without waiting to be asked [1], to volunteer [1], and to donate supplies immediately [1]. The Ministry also encourages those who can offer their skills and expertise to help in the rebuilding effort [4]. Charles Jr., from the Ministry, has called on other Jamaicans to join the cause, noting that relief outreach is supported by non-governmental organizations, partners, and volunteers [6].

To ensure no one is left behind, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security works alongside teams from other ministries, including local government and community development, education and youth, and health and wellness, as well as NGOs like Red Cross and Food for the Poor [4]. These teams are going house to house to promptly deploy islandwide, deliver immediate relief supplies, and conduct initial damage assessments [4]. The Ministry has also provided 612 hygiene kits and 159 cases of water [6]. Efforts are being made to utilize community leaders to work with Members of Parliament [6]. The Ministry acknowledges the frustration, the fear of children, and the concerns of seniors regarding their medicines and where they are staying [6].

**Question:**  How has the agricultural sector in Jamaica been impacted by Hurricane Beryl, and what steps are being taken to address these impacts?
**Answer:** Hurricane Beryl caused significant damage to agriculture and other livelihoods, such as fishing, in Jamaica [1]. The effects on crops and fishing are also evident [10]. The most affected parishes included St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, Manchester, Westmoreland, and Hanover, with impacts also reported in other parishes [1].

To address these impacts, the Government of Jamaica has announced that the focus would be on recovery [2]. The Prime Minister issued the Disaster Risk Management Enforcement Measures Order 2024, declaring Jamaica a disaster area [2][6]. The Government has formally acknowledged and accepted the offer of support from the United Nations (UN) [7]. The UN Resident Coordinator (RC) activated the United Nations Emergency Technical Team (UNETT) and reassured the Government of Jamaica of the UN's readiness to support [2][6]. The Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) and other government agencies started rapid needs assessments [6]. UNICEF participated in joint assessments organized by ODPEM on July 8th and 10th [7]. Humanitarians, including teams from OCHA and UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC), continue to work with authorities to complete assessments and deliver assistance in affected areas [9]. The UN allocated US$4 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support humanitarian operations in Grenada, Jamaica, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines [5][9]. UNICEF is also jointly working with other agencies under the leadership of the UN RC/HC to prepare a joint appeal for Jamaica to support the response [10].

**Question:**  What specific actions are being implemented by USAID (United States Agency for International Development) to support recovery efforts in Jamaica, particularly in terms of market-based assistance and logistical operations?
**Answer:** USAID intends to provide market-based assistance to help affected residents purchase basic household commodities and other needed items [1][3][5]. Additionally, USAID plans to support logistical operations [1]. USAID also intends to partner to repair homes, assist with water and sanitation needs, and provide essential relief items such as clean-up kits, hygiene kits, and tarps [1]. USAID has disaster experts on the ground in Jamaica, actively supporting damage assessments and coordination efforts [2].

## SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure

**Question:**  What specific measures are being implemented to address the obstruction of access due to ongoing rains and debris in Jamaica, and how are these affecting aid delivery and assessments?
**Answer:** Ongoing rains and debris are obstructing access in Jamaica, delaying aid delivery and assessments [1]. Humanitarian access is also challenged by flooding, debris from fallen trees, landslides, and infrastructural damage [6]. To address this, recovery efforts include "debushing and the carting away of debris" and "cleaning and desilting of drains" [7]. The chief of defence staff has been instructed to mobilize the Disaster Assistance and Recovery Team and other supporting units, including engineers, to assist with rebuilding and recovery in areas with the greatest damage, such as Rocky Point and Portland Cottage [2]. Social workers are conducting daily assessments and providing support, including mattresses, food packages, and tarpaulins, to impacted residents [7].

**Question:**  What are the primary challenges faced in accessing remote and rural areas in Jamaica due to infrastructural damage, and how are these affecting the delivery of aid and restoration services?
**Answer:** Accessing remote and rural areas in Jamaica is challenging due to flooding, debris from fallen trees, landslides, and infrastructural damage [1]. Blocked roads specifically delay aid and restoration services [1][2].

**Question:**  What challenges are being faced in communicating with affected areas in Clarendon and St Elizabeth, Jamaica, and what strategies are being employed to overcome these communication barriers?
**Answer:** Communication with affected areas in Clarendon and some areas of St Elizabeth is challenging because communication is completely down, preventing officers from communicating on either telecommunication provider [1]. Telecommunication service remains a challenge in St Elizabeth [2]. The lack of communication and coverage from partners has hampered government work, as telecommunications providers Digicel and Flow were dependent on JPS Jamaica Public Service for electricity [3]. Most of St Elizabeth is without power, and power must be restored first for Digicel and Flow to provide connectivity to customers [9]. This difficulty in communication is why some people are not hearing from teams [4].

To overcome these communication barriers, teams are going house to house to promptly deploy islandwide, deliver immediate relief supplies, and conduct initial damage assessments [1]. Efforts are being made by Digicel Jamaica to restore connectivity in St Elizabeth [2]. The government is speaking with telecommunications providers Digicel and Flow regarding coverage [3]. There is an effort to get across the network and utilize as many community leaders as possible to work with Members of Parliament [4]. Restoring power is a crucial step for Digicel and Flow to be able to provide connectivity [9]. The government will also need to consider greater use of technology [3].

**Question:**  What challenges are being faced in terms of communication in the affected areas of Jamaica, and how are community leaders and Members of Parliament addressing these issues to ensure effective coordination of relief efforts?
**Answer:** Challenges being faced in terms of communication in the affected areas of Jamaica include difficulty in communication [1], a lack of communication and coverage from partners [3], and communication being completely down in some areas [5]. This difficulty is partly due to dependence on Jamaica Public Service (JPS) for electricity [3]. Telecommunication service remains a challenge in St Elizabeth [6].

To address these issues and ensure effective coordination of relief efforts, the effort is to get across the network and utilize as many community leaders as possible to work with Members of Parliament (MPs) [1]. The Government is speaking with telecommunications providers Digicel and Flow regarding communication and coverage [3]. Efforts are also being made by Digicel Jamaica to restore connectivity in St Elizabeth [6]. Teams from ministries such as local government and community development, education and youth, and health and wellness, along with NGOs like Red Cross and Food for the Poor, are working alongside the Labour Ministry, going house to house to deploy immediate relief supplies and conduct initial damage assessments, particularly in areas where communication is down [5].

**Answer:** To address the significant damage to livelihood infrastructure in the southern region of Jamaica following Hurricane Beryl, several measures are being implemented:

*   **Damage Assessment and Recovery Planning:** The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is deployed in affected areas of the Caribbean, including Jamaica, to advance rapid needs assessment and prepare proposals to restore production and livelihoods [1][2][5]. This includes damage and needs assessment using drones and satellite remote sensing, along with ground-level data collection through surveys and key informant interviews, all of which will guide response and recovery planning [1][2][5]. USAID also has disaster experts on the ground in Jamaica actively supporting damage assessments and coordination efforts [8].
*   **Direct Assistance and Financial Support:** Families in southern coastal areas, including Clarendon, Manchester, and St. Elizabeth, are in need of access to clean water, food, and reconstruction supplies for their homes, as well as psychological support [4][6]. In St Elizabeth, the Jamaica Public Service (JPS) Foundation and Food For The Poor (FFTP) Jamaica are providing care packages and access to charging stations [7]. Support to social protection systems is being implemented, including potential provision of food assistance to affected populations through existing government systems and modalities, and direct World Food Programme (WFP) assistance as required, utilizing cash-based transfers (CBT) and/or vouchers [13]. Investments in CBT assistance are expected to be complemented by a top-up of Jamaica's Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) policy, which, if triggered, will direct a fixed percentage of a potential CCRIF payout towards providing cash transfers to impacted people via the country's social protection system [13].
*   **Infrastructure Restoration:** Hurricane Beryl most severely impacted Jamaica's southern coastal areas, causing damage to telecommunications, infrastructure, housing, public buildings, and healthcare facilities [4][6]. The Jamaica Public Service (JPS) and the National Water Commission (NWC) are working to restore utility services, including electricity and water, in affected communities [14].

**Question:**  How is the Jamaican government prioritizing the fast-tracking of repairs to markets damaged by Hurricane Beryl, and what is the status of these efforts?
**Answer:** The Jamaican government is prioritizing the fast-tracking of repairs to markets damaged by Hurricane Beryl [2]. The Falmouth, Mandeville, Lucea, and Old Harbour markets, located in Trelawny, Manchester, Hanover, and St Catherine respectively, were significantly impacted by the hurricane's gale-force winds and torrential rains [2]. Earlier in the year, the Government had announced a 500-million programme for markets across the country [2].

## SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities

**Question:**  How is the REACH (Relief Emergency Assistance and Community Help) programme structured to ensure the equitable distribution of food and essential supplies in the most affected areas of Jamaica?
**Answer:** The REACH (Relief Emergency Assistance and Community Help) programme includes the distribution of food and essential supplies as one of its main elements [1]. The government is coordinating the continued distribution of food, water, medical sundries, and other essentials to citizens in the most affected areas [1].

To ensure equitable distribution, the Prime Minister stated that the process for determining who is assisted must be "absolutely transparent" to prevent favoritism [2]. He is developing a system that integrates past experiences and technology to properly identify "the needy beneficiary and not the greedy person" [2]. This relief is intended to be non-partisan and transparent [2][5], with distribution carried out by all members of parliament in a non-partisan way, emphasizing "there is no colour or affiliation in a disaster" [5]. The process relies on assessments from entities such as the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM), utilities, and public infrastructure [5]. Support is provided to communities where damage is greatest, such as Rocky Point and Portland Cottage [5].

**Question:**  How is the REACH (Relief Emergency Assistance and Community Help) programme structured to ensure the equitable distribution of food and essential supplies, and what criteria are used to determine the allocation of resources to the most affected areas in Jamaica?
**Answer:** The REACH (Relief Emergency Assistance and Community Help) programme is structured to ensure the equitable distribution of food and essential supplies through a transparent and non-partisan process [2][3]. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security has been handing out care packages [1], which contain enough food for a family of four for four days [1][2]. The government coordinates the continued distribution of food, water, medical sundries, and other essentials [1]. An initial allocation of $5 million was provided for welfare activities, including food distribution [1][7], and an additional $4 million is allocated to all 63 constituencies to assist in the recovery effort [2].

The criteria used to determine the allocation of resources to the most affected areas in Jamaica involve a transparent assessment process [2][3]. This assessment is conducted by the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM), utilities, and public infrastructure [3]. Based on this assessment, constituencies are informed if they are categorized as "severely impacted" [3]. Support is provided to communities where virtually the entire housing stock has been destroyed [3], and assistance is directed to areas where the damage is greatest, such as Rocky Point and Portland Cottage on the south coast of Jamaica [3]. The process aims to properly identify the needy beneficiary [2].

**Question:**  How is Appliance Traders Ltd (ATL) addressing the increased demand for power generators in Jamaica following Hurricane Beryl, and what challenges have they faced in meeting this demand?
**Answer:** Appliance Traders Ltd (ATL) is addressing the increased demand for power generators by having more units "on the way" [1]. The challenge they faced was that the smaller, portable power supply products were "snatched up" before Hurricane Beryl even arrived [1]. Customers began purchasing these generators as soon as Hurricane Beryl was named and tracked to be in Jamaica's direct line of sight [1].

**Question:**  What measures are being taken by ATL to ensure an adequate supply of generators in Jamaica during the hurricane season, given the increased demand and potential supply chain delays?
**Answer:** ATL is taking several measures to ensure an adequate supply of generators in Jamaica during the hurricane season. They have ordered more generators to come in for the five-month hurricane season [2]. ATL also plans to adjust by having more than one container of generators arrive in stock and be dispatched to various locations well ahead of time, anticipating potential changes in weather patterns and an earlier season next year [2]. Furthermore, ATL assures the public that they will not increase prices during the hurricane season to protect their customers [1][4]. They intend to apply the same principle as for air conditioning units, putting generators on sale when demand is greater, without increasing prices above their normal rates [4].

**Question:**  What updates have been provided by agency partners and stakeholders regarding their state of readiness for the hurricane season in Jamaica, and how are these updates informing the overall preparedness strategy?
**Answer:** Agency partners and other stakeholders were asked to provide an update on their state of readiness for the hurricane season [1]. The specific content of these updates is not detailed in the provided sources. However, regarding readiness, one supplier indicated they had limited stock of an unspecified item, selling 10 units on Monday and 11 on Tuesday before running out [2]. Another business noted high demand for generators, stating they may not be able to supply everyone's needs, and had ordered more, expecting the hurricane season to last five months [3]. This business also assured the public they would not increase prices during the hurricane season [2][4].

These observations are informing the overall preparedness strategy by highlighting the need to always be prepared once the hurricane season begins, especially as hurricanes are developing earlier in the season, aligning with climate change predictions [1]. This suggests businesses may need to adjust by having more generators in stock and dispatched to various locations well in advance, as the season could potentially start earlier than the traditional June [3].

**Question:**  How is the collaboration among different agencies, such as the Jamaica Constabulary Force and Jamaica Red Cross, being coordinated to enhance disaster readiness and response efforts in Jamaica during the hurricane season?

**Question:**  What challenges are being faced in communicating with affected areas in Clarendon and St Elizabeth, Jamaica, and what strategies are being employed to overcome these communication barriers?
**Answer:** Communication with affected areas in Clarendon and some areas of St Elizabeth is challenging because communication is completely down, preventing officers from communicating on either telecommunication provider [1]. Telecommunication service remains a challenge in St Elizabeth [2]. The lack of communication and coverage from partners has hampered government work, as telecommunications providers Digicel and Flow were dependent on JPS Jamaica Public Service for electricity [3]. Most of St Elizabeth is without power, and power must be restored first for Digicel and Flow to provide connectivity to customers [9]. This difficulty in communication is why some people are not hearing from teams [4].

To overcome these communication barriers, teams are going house to house to promptly deploy islandwide, deliver immediate relief supplies, and conduct initial damage assessments [1]. Efforts are being made by Digicel Jamaica to restore connectivity in St Elizabeth [2]. The government is speaking with telecommunications providers Digicel and Flow regarding coverage [3]. There is an effort to get across the network and utilize as many community leaders as possible to work with Members of Parliament [4]. Restoring power is a crucial step for Digicel and Flow to be able to provide connectivity [9]. The government will also need to consider greater use of technology [3].

**Question:**  What challenges are being faced in terms of communication in the affected areas of Jamaica, and how are community leaders and Members of Parliament addressing these issues to ensure effective coordination of relief efforts?
**Answer:** Challenges being faced in terms of communication in the affected areas of Jamaica include difficulty in communication [1], a lack of communication and coverage from partners [3], and communication being completely down in some areas [5]. This difficulty is partly due to dependence on Jamaica Public Service (JPS) for electricity [3]. Telecommunication service remains a challenge in St Elizabeth [6].

To address these issues and ensure effective coordination of relief efforts, the effort is to get across the network and utilize as many community leaders as possible to work with Members of Parliament (MPs) [1]. The Government is speaking with telecommunications providers Digicel and Flow regarding communication and coverage [3]. Efforts are also being made by Digicel Jamaica to restore connectivity in St Elizabeth [6]. Teams from ministries such as local government and community development, education and youth, and health and wellness, along with NGOs like Red Cross and Food for the Poor, are working alongside the Labour Ministry, going house to house to deploy immediate relief supplies and conduct initial damage assessments, particularly in areas where communication is down [5].

**Question:**  How is the Ministry of Labour and Social Security in Jamaica encouraging public participation in the rebuilding efforts, and what specific actions are being taken to ensure no one is left behind in the recovery process?
**Answer:** The Ministry of Labour and Social Security is committed to leaving no one behind and encourages all Jamaicans, particularly those in a better position, to join in the work of rebuilding the nation [1]. They urge individuals to assist by reaching out without waiting to be asked [1], to volunteer [1], and to donate supplies immediately [1]. The Ministry also encourages those who can offer their skills and expertise to help in the rebuilding effort [4]. Charles Jr., from the Ministry, has called on other Jamaicans to join the cause, noting that relief outreach is supported by non-governmental organizations, partners, and volunteers [6].

To ensure no one is left behind, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security works alongside teams from other ministries, including local government and community development, education and youth, and health and wellness, as well as NGOs like Red Cross and Food for the Poor [4]. These teams are going house to house to promptly deploy islandwide, deliver immediate relief supplies, and conduct initial damage assessments [4]. The Ministry has also provided 612 hygiene kits and 159 cases of water [6]. Efforts are being made to utilize community leaders to work with Members of Parliament [6]. The Ministry acknowledges the frustration, the fear of children, and the concerns of seniors regarding their medicines and where they are staying [6].

**Question:**  How are non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and volunteers collaborating with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security in Jamaica to provide immediate relief and conduct damage assessments following Hurricane Beryl?
**Answer:** The Ministry of Labour and Social Security is committed to leaving no one behind and encourages all Jamaicans, particularly those in a better position, to join in the work of rebuilding the nation [2]. Teams from other ministries, including local government and community development, education and youth, and health and wellness, along with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Red Cross and Food for the Poor, have been working alongside the Labour Ministry [3]. These teams are going house to house to promptly deploy islandwide, deliver immediate relief supplies, and conduct initial damage assessments [3]. The relief outreach is also being done with the aid of several NGOs, other partners, and volunteers [4]. Jamaicans are encouraged to volunteer, get out of their houses, and donate supplies [2]. Community members have also assisted with managing shelters [9] and fixing damaged roofs [12].

**Question:**  What role is UNICEF playing in the joint assessments organized by the Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM), and what are the key findings from these assessments?
**Answer:** UNICEF participated in two joint assessments organized by the Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) on July 8th and 10th to the affected areas [1]. A report covering the period from 10 to 13 July 2024 indicated that the storm caused significant damage to shelters, infrastructure including water, electricity and health infrastructure, agriculture and other livelihoods such as fishing [10]. The most affected parishes were reported to be St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, Manchester, Westmoreland and Hanover, with impacts also reported in other parishes [10].

**Question:**  How has the Government of Jamaica coordinated with international organizations, such as the United Nations, to address the aftermath of Hurricane Beryl, and what specific support has been accepted?
**Answer:** The Government of Jamaica has formally acknowledged and accepted the offer of support from the United Nations (UN) [1]. This acceptance allows UN agencies to support vulnerable populations [1].

Specific instances of coordination and support include:
*   On July 9, Minister Dana Morris Dixon from the Prime Minister's office briefed the International Development Partners Group, chaired by the UN Resident Coordinator (RC), on the situation and government relief efforts [2]. Minister Dixon expressed appreciation for the support offered by the international community and openness to work together [2].
*   The RC activated the United Nations Emergency Technical Team (UNETT) and reassured the Government of Jamaica that the UN was ready to support [2][4]. The UNETT, co-shared by UNICEF and WFP, continues to support the RCO lead in the joint UN response [1].
*   UNICEF participated in two joint assessments organized by the Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) on July 8 and 10 in affected areas [1].
*   UNICEF is also jointly working with other agencies under the leadership of UN RCHC to prepare a joint appeal for Jamaica to support the response [3].
*   The UN allocated US$4 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support humanitarian operations in Grenada, Jamaica, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines [6][10].
*   Humanitarians, including teams from OCHA and UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC), continue to work with authorities in Jamaica to complete assessments and deliver assistance in affected areas [10].

**Question:**  What updates have been provided by agency partners and stakeholders regarding their state of readiness for the hurricane season in Jamaica, and how are these updates informing the overall preparedness strategy?
**Answer:** Agency partners and other stakeholders were asked to provide an update on their state of readiness for the hurricane season [1]. The specific content of these updates is not detailed in the provided sources. However, regarding readiness, one supplier indicated they had limited stock of an unspecified item, selling 10 units on Monday and 11 on Tuesday before running out [2]. Another business noted high demand for generators, stating they may not be able to supply everyone's needs, and had ordered more, expecting the hurricane season to last five months [3]. This business also assured the public they would not increase prices during the hurricane season [2][4].

These observations are informing the overall preparedness strategy by highlighting the need to always be prepared once the hurricane season begins, especially as hurricanes are developing earlier in the season, aligning with climate change predictions [1]. This suggests businesses may need to adjust by having more generators in stock and dispatched to various locations well in advance, as the season could potentially start earlier than the traditional June [3].

**Question:**  How is the collaboration among different agencies, such as the Jamaica Constabulary Force and Jamaica Red Cross, being coordinated to enhance disaster readiness and response efforts in Jamaica during the hurricane season?
**Answer:** Representatives from agencies, including the Jamaica Constabulary Force and Jamaica Red Cross, attend meetings and are asked to provide an update on their state of readiness [1].

**Question:**  What specific actions are being implemented by USAID (United States Agency for International Development) to support recovery efforts in Jamaica, particularly in terms of market-based assistance and logistical operations?
**Answer:** USAID intends to provide market-based assistance to help affected residents purchase basic household commodities and other needed items [1][3][5]. Additionally, USAID plans to support logistical operations [1]. USAID also intends to partner to repair homes, assist with water and sanitation needs, and provide essential relief items such as clean-up kits, hygiene kits, and tarps [1]. USAID has disaster experts on the ground in Jamaica, actively supporting damage assessments and coordination efforts [2].
