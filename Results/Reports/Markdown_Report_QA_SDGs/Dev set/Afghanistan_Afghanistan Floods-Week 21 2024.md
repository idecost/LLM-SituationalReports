# Afghanistan_Afghanistan Floods-Week 21 2024

## Summary
Afghanistan is experiencing severe flooding across its western, northern, and northeastern regions, marking the largest flooding event this year and affecting thousands of families[46]. These floods have led to significant casualties, with at least 347 fatalities and over 1,651 injuries reported in Baghlan, Badakhshan, and Takhar provinces alone, and overall casualties are expected to increase[64]. The disaster has caused extensive damage to infrastructure, including approximately 9,000 homes, vital bridges, roads, health facilities, and schools, while also destroying nearly 14,000 livestock and 24,000 hectares of agricultural land, making many affected areas inaccessible[39]. Humanitarian organizations such as WHO, WFP, and UNICEF, along with various clusters (Health, Protection, Shelter, Food Security and Agriculture Cluster), are actively providing emergency response, including medical supplies, food assistance, emergency shelter, hygiene kits, and addressing critical needs like clean water, mental health support, and disease surveillance[7]. While some food prices saw a negligible decrease in May 2024, they remain significantly higher than pre-COVID levels, and acute malnutrition is above emergency thresholds in most provinces[32]. Additionally, Afghanistan continues to manage the return of over 589,700 individuals recorded up to May 18, 2024, primarily from Pakistan[17].

## SDG 1 - No Poverty

**Question:** What impact has the stable exchange rate of the Afghani (AFN) against the US Dollar (USD) had on the purchasing power of humanitarian cash assistance in Afghanistan?
**Answer:** The appreciation of the Afghani (AFN) against the US Dollar (USD), which has led to the AFN remaining relatively stable between AFN 70 and AFN 74 per USD since November 2023 [1][9], has been credited as a factor contributing to persistent deflation [8].

**Question:** What impact has the appreciation of the Afghani (AFN) against the US Dollar (USD) had on the purchasing power of households in Afghanistan, particularly in relation to food security?
**Answer:** The appreciation of the Afghani (AFN) against the US Dollar (USD) has been credited as a factor contributing to persistent deflation [9]. The AFN consistently appreciated against the USD throughout 2023 [8][10]. This trend coincides with a significant decrease in the prices of most food items compared to the same period last year [1]. The value of the World Food Program (WFP) in-kind food basket in Afghani showed a continuous decline from June 2022 to September 2023, followed by a decrease in December 2023 [3]. The national average exchange rate has remained relatively stable between AFN 70 and AFN 74 per USD since November 2023 [1][10].

**Question:** What specific measures are being implemented to ensure that the FSAC's food assistance packages meet the minimum acceptable humanitarian standards across Afghanistan?
**Answer:** To ensure that the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC)'s food assistance packages meet the minimum acceptable humanitarian standards across Afghanistan, a uniform approach is used where relevant to avoid inequality, harm, and improper utilization of resources [1][2]. Basic rules for designing food assistance packages include providing a minimum of 2100 kcal per person per day for emergencies, with rations designed to meet the "food gap" after considering populations' capacity to meet their own food needs [5]. The design of these packages also considers beneficiaries' preferences and consumption habits, incorporating feedback from partners [5]. Additionally, the guidelines for these packages are thoroughly discussed with FSAC partners, donors, and humanitarian agencies in various FSAC meetings, and are approved and agreed upon by all relevant stakeholders [11].

**Question:**  **Protection Needs:** What specific protection challenges do Afghan returnees face upon their return, particularly in terms of food security, financial aid, and housing, as identified by the Multi-Sectoral Rapid Needs Assessment Teams (MRAT)?
**Answer:** A considerable number of returnee and host population households encounter notable difficulties concerning food security, financial aid, and housing, as identified by the Multi-Sectoral Rapid Needs Assessment Teams (MRAT) [1].

**Question:**  **Impact Assessment:** What is the total number of people affected by the floods in Afghanistan since the beginning of the year, and which provinces have been most severely impacted?
**Answer:** More than 30,000 people have been affected by floods across Afghanistan since the beginning of the year [1]. Prior to the most recent flooding episode, 30,055 people had been affected [2][3].

Recent floods have mostly hit the country's northern regions [1]. Provinces that have been significantly impacted include Faryab [1][8], Ghor [3][8], Baghlan [3][5][9][11][14][17], and Takhar [5][6][10][11][12]. Prior to the latest flooding, the southern and western regions were mainly affected [2][3]. UNICEF is focusing its response plan primarily on the most flood-affected provinces in the northern and western regions [13].

**Question:**  **Emergency Response:** What immediate interventions are UNICEF Emergency Response Teams implementing in the flood-affected areas, and what essential supplies are being provided?
**Answer:** UNICEF Emergency Response Teams are on the ground supporting ongoing interventions in the flood-affected areas [1]. These interventions include water trucking [1][6][10] and the provision of essential supplies [1][6][10]. The essential supplies provided include hygiene kits [1][6][10], family kits [1][6][10], blankets [1][6][10], tarpaulins [1][6][10], floor mats [1], teaching and learning materials [1], High-Performance Tents to allow educational services to resume [1], and multi-purpose cash [6][10].

**Question:**  What specific additional resources are urgently needed to replenish emergency stockpiles in Afghanistan, and how can these resources be mobilized effectively to support flood-affected communities?
**Answer:** Additional resources urgently required to replenish emergency stockpiles in Afghanistan include tents, Non-Food Items (NFIs), emergency shelter repair tool kits, and plastic tarpaulin [12]. Further prepositioning and mobilization of medical supplies and resources are needed to alleviate the suffering of flood-affected communities [10]. Mobilization efforts face challenges due to road damages and the destruction of main roads and bridges, which hinder the transportation of essential supplies and isolate communities [8][13][15]. To effectively support these communities, alternative transportation methods are necessary to reach isolated areas [15]. Additionally, enhancing collaboration among partners is crucial for a more coordinated and effective response, involving improved information sharing, coordinated activities, and leveraging each partner's strengths to maximize impact, leading to better resource allocation and reduced duplication of efforts [9].

**Question:**  How is the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) planning to support flood-affected people in specific districts, and what coordination efforts are being made to ensure effective response and support?
**Answer:** FSAC partners plan to reach flood-affected people in the districts of Maimana, Qaysar, Almar, Dawlat Abad, Bilcheragh, Gurziwan, Pashtun Kot, Khwaja Sabz Posh, Ferozkoh, Charsada, Pasaband, Shahrak, Tolak, and Saghar [1]. To ensure effective response and support, a regional FSAC team will be deployed to provide coordination and response support once the road from Hirat to Ghor is reopened [1].

**Question:**  What challenges are humanitarian partners facing in reaching vulnerable populations in flood-affected districts due to road damages, and what alternative transportation methods are being considered to overcome these challenges?
**Answer:** Humanitarian partners face challenges in reaching vulnerable populations in flood-affected districts due to road damages [1]. Essential supplies cannot be transported through the road network in Guzargahe Noor district, Baghlan province [1]. WHO and Health Cluster partners have difficulties reaching affected populations due to severe damage to transportation infrastructure, including roads and bridges [6]. This results in isolated communities, and movement between villages is hindered by flowing rivers [6]. Additionally, the blockade of the Herat to Ghor road is hindering the delivery of emergency supplies from Herat [6]. The destruction of main roads and bridges necessitates alternative transportation methods to reach isolated areas [7].

**Question:**  What are the key protection risks identified in Afghanistan's flood-affected areas, and how are these risks impacting vulnerable groups such as women, girls, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and persons with disabilities?
**Answer:** Key protection risks identified in Afghanistan's flood-affected areas include protracted displacement, mine and explosive ordnance contamination, discrimination, and denial of access to services, resources, and humanitarian assistance [3]. Other risks are restrictions to freedom of movement, a growing threat of forced evictions, increased risks of gender-based violence (GBV), child labour, and early marriage [3]. There are also heightened needs for mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) [3][7][9], psychological first aid (PFA) [1], and concerns regarding civil documentation [1][3][9].

These risks contribute to a shrinking protection space [3]. They particularly affect women, girls, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees, persons living with disabilities, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups [3]. Protection partners are mobilizing resources to address specific needs such as MHPSS and legal assistance for vulnerable groups [7].

**Question:**  How is the World Food Programme (WFP) responding to the recent floods in Afghanistan, and what are the immediate and long-term strategies being implemented to support affected communities?
**Answer:** The World Food Programme (WFP) is responding to the recent floods in Afghanistan with both immediate and long-term strategies [1][2][5][10][12].

**Immediate Response:**
WFP activated its contingency response plan, triggered by its early warning system, and prepositioned food stocks in Herat and Mazar ahead of the rains [5][8]. WFP's area office mobilized within three hours of the floods to dispatch and distribute fortified biscuits and lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) for blanket distribution in all affected locations [10]. Immediate distributions to accessible affected households included high-energy biscuits, nutritional supplements, and subsidized bread rations [5][10]. Blanket food assistance has been distributed to affected populations in all currently accessible areas [4]. By the end of last week, WFP started providing food rations and cash assistance where markets were functional [12]. From May 15, WFP initiated multi-purpose cash assistance of AFN 6,400 (USD 87.7) to flood-affected populations, collaborating with partners on joint distributions [4]. WFP is also erecting and replacing rub-halls (mobile storage units) to serve as hubs, setting up new rub-halls for storage, and sending food trucks to a second hub [4]. Joint Assessment teams are in the field reporting on priority locations, scale, and impact [8].

**Long-term Strategies:**
Following initial distributions, WFP plans to provide food and nutrition assistance with a 100 percent ration for two months, followed by a reduced distribution at 50 percent for the remaining four months [5][10]. Resilience activities will be incorporated into the recovery program, targeting affected communities to mediate further loss [10]. WFP has called for an additional $14.5 million to assist flood-affected people with "emergency food and nutrition assistance and resilience-building projects" [2]. WFP is investing in climate adaptation projects, designed and built by communities, to shield them from the impacts of the climate crisis, including protective walls, dams, and irrigation canals [12].

**Question:**  What are the specific challenges faced by families like Hanifa's in Behsood e Markazi district during the winter, and how is cash distribution being utilized to address these challenges?
**Answer:** Families like Hanifa's in the Behsood e Markazi district face a dire economic situation due to a lack of job opportunities for women [1] and significant challenges coping with the harsh winter [1]. Her son, who is the family's caretaker, can only work for approximately three to four months a year, which must sustain them through the entire winter [2]. During winter, he is unemployed, and the family relies on support from relief agencies and other villagers [5]. Most residents in this remote, mountainous district live below the poverty line and lack access to basic needs [5]. Despite owning agricultural plots, they struggle to afford basic winter necessities due to limited opportunities and long winters that prevent them from earning sufficient incomes [5]. Hanifa's 90-year-old mother-in-law is gravely ill and requires a warm room and winter clothes [2].

Cash distribution is utilized to address these challenges by providing emergency support for winterisation needs [2]. People in Need, with funding from the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, distributed cash for winterisation assistance to nearly 13,000 people in 51 villages and 6 districts in Maidan Wardak, Central Afghanistan [2]. Hanifa's family received cash after their home was surveyed and their financial situation and challenges, including her mother-in-law's need for a warm room and winter clothes, were assessed [2]. The World Food Programme (WFP) also initiated multi-purpose cash assistance (AFN 6,400 / USD 87.7) to flood-affected populations, designed to complement the average income of Afghani households and enable them to meet their essential needs [8]. WFP provides cash assistance in areas where markets are functional [17].

**Question:**  How is the "Goodness Train" initiative by Trkiye's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) contributing to the humanitarian response in Afghanistan, and what types of aid are being prioritized?
**Answer:** The "Goodness Train" initiative, organized by Trkiye's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), is contributing to the humanitarian response in Afghanistan by delivering aid to flood victims [1]. This campaign was launched amid Afghanistan's calls for international aid [2]. The train carries an assortment of humanitarian aid collected by AFAD and 17 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) [1]. Trkiye had previously sent emergency aid by plane [2]. The "Goodness Train" series of campaigns for Afghanistan began after the 2022 turmoil [2].

The types of aid prioritized on this train include 600 tents, food, hygiene kits, beds, and blankets [1]. In total, the train carries 619 tons of aid [1].

## SDG 2 - Zero Hunger

**Question:** What impact has the appreciation of the Afghani (AFN) against the US Dollar (USD) had on the purchasing power of households in Afghanistan, particularly in relation to food security?
**Answer:** The appreciation of the Afghani (AFN) against the US Dollar (USD) has been credited as a factor contributing to persistent deflation [9]. The AFN consistently appreciated against the USD throughout 2023 [8][10]. This trend coincides with a significant decrease in the prices of most food items compared to the same period last year [1]. The value of the World Food Program (WFP) in-kind food basket in Afghani showed a continuous decline from June 2022 to September 2023, followed by a decrease in December 2023 [3]. The national average exchange rate has remained relatively stable between AFN 70 and AFN 74 per USD since November 2023 [1][10].

Additionally, the guidelines for these packages are thoroughly discussed with FSAC partners, donors, and humanitarian agencies in various FSAC meetings, and are approved and agreed upon by all relevant stakeholders [11].

**Question:** How are the recent trends in global food and fertilizer prices affecting the cost and availability of food and agricultural inputs in Afghanistan?
**Answer:** In the third week of May 2024, the prices of staple foods such as wheat flour, rice, and cooking oil in Afghanistan experienced a downward trend, which is attributed to a marginal decline in their global prices [1]. The national average fertilizer prices are also on a downward trend, showing a significant decrease compared to the same time last year, due to a decrease in global fertilizer prices and reduced domestic demand [8].

**Question:**  **Protection Needs:** What specific protection challenges do Afghan returnees face upon their return, particularly in terms of food security, financial aid, and housing, as identified by the Multi-Sectoral Rapid Needs Assessment Teams (MRAT)?
**Answer:** A considerable number of returnee and host population households encounter notable difficulties concerning food security, financial aid, and housing, as identified by the Multi-Sectoral Rapid Needs Assessment Teams (MRAT) [1].

Additionally, enhancing collaboration among partners is crucial for a more coordinated and effective response, involving improved information sharing, coordinated activities, and leveraging each partner's strengths to maximize impact, leading to better resource allocation and reduced duplication of efforts [9].

**Question:**  How is the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) planning to support flood-affected people in specific districts, and what coordination efforts are being made to ensure effective response and support?
**Answer:** FSAC partners plan to reach flood-affected people in the districts of Maimana, Qaysar, Almar, Dawlat Abad, Bilcheragh, Gurziwan, Pashtun Kot, Khwaja Sabz Posh, Ferozkoh, Charsada, Pasaband, Shahrak, Tolak, and Saghar [1]. To ensure effective response and support, a regional FSAC team will be deployed to provide coordination and response support once the road from Hirat to Ghor is reopened [1].

**Question:**  How is the Early Warning Information Working Group (EWIWG) addressing the forecasted below-average precipitation and above-average temperatures in Afghanistan, and what measures are being taken to mitigate potential impacts on agriculture and food security?
**Answer:** The Early Warning Information Working Group (EWIWG) addresses forecasted weather patterns by delivering comprehensive presentations on early warning information to cluster partners [5][6][7][8]. These presentations include details on precipitation forecasts, such as rainfall for the 2023-24 winter wet season (October 2023 to March 2024) being most likely below average [6][8]. However, for January 2023 to March 2024, there was a likely chance of above-average precipitation in most of Afghanistan [5][7], though rainfall analysis since November 1 shows below-average precipitation [5]. Between December 2023 and January 2024, the country experienced below-average precipitation, but February had significant precipitation [7]. Average precipitation is most likely from March to May 2024 [6][8]. Regarding temperatures, above-average temperatures were forecasted for the whole year [3], and unseasonably warm temperatures have contributed to floods [1]. As of March 15, 2024, snowpack is below average throughout the country [15]. The provided sources do not detail specific measures taken by the EWIWG to mitigate potential impacts on agriculture and food security beyond presenting this early warning information.

**Question:**  How is the World Food Programme (WFP) responding to the recent floods in Afghanistan, and what are the immediate and long-term strategies being implemented to support affected communities?
**Answer:** The World Food Programme (WFP) is responding to the recent floods in Afghanistan with both immediate and long-term strategies [1][2][5][10][12].

The types of aid prioritized on this train include 600 tents, food, hygiene kits, beds, and blankets [1]. In total, the train carries 619 tons of aid [1].

## SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being

**Question:**  What is the current status of health facilities in the flood-affected regions, and how are they coping with the increased demand for medical services?
**Answer:** Several health facilities in the western region are currently partially or non-operational due to extensive flood damage [1]. In Baghlan province, several health facilities have been affected and reported as non-operational [3]. Significant damage to public infrastructure, including health services, has been reported in the Northeast Region [4]. Infrastructure damage, including health facilities, has also occurred in Baghlan, Badakhshan, and Takhar provinces [6][5][12][14].

To support affected health facilities and communities, WHO successfully transported a significant consignment of 30 metric tonnes of essential medicines, medical kits, tents, and solar lights to Ghor province [1]. The WHO Afghanistan Office delivered 25 metric tonnes of emergency medical kits, tents, and solar lights to Ghor province [2]. Additionally, WHO is mobilizing an additional 5 metric tonnes of medicines and medical supplies from its Mazar warehouse to Faryab Provincial Hospital and partners' Mobile Health Teams providing health services in affected districts of Faryab province [2].

**Question:**  **Impact Assessment:** What is the total number of people affected by the floods in Afghanistan since the beginning of the year, and which provinces have been most severely impacted?
**Answer:** More than 30,000 people have been affected by floods across Afghanistan since the beginning of the year [1]. Prior to the most recent flooding episode, 30,055 people had been affected [2][3].

Recent floods have mostly hit the country's northern regions [1]. Provinces that have been significantly impacted include Faryab [1][8], Ghor [3][8], Baghlan [3][5][9][11][14][17], and Takhar [5][6][10][11][12]. Prior to the latest flooding, the southern and western regions were mainly affected [2][3]. UNICEF is focusing its response plan primarily on the most flood-affected provinces in the northern and western regions [13].

**Question:**  **Child Protection:** What are the preliminary findings of the Child Protection Area of Responsibility rapid assessment, and how many children are identified as needing protection services?
**Answer:** Preliminary results from the Child Protection Area of Responsibility (CPAoR) rapid assessment show that 554 children are in need of child protection services [1][2]. Of these, 290 are girls and 264 are boys [1][2].

**Question:**  What are the specific medical and technical support needs identified by the WHO (World Health Organization) assessment teams in Ghor Province, and how are they being addressed?
**Answer:** An assessment of Ghor Provincial Hospital revealed a critical need for medicine and medical supplies in the affected district [2]. To address these needs, an additional team of four WHO members has joined Ghor response teams to provide additional medical and technical support to the response operations [2]. WHO also distributes essential medical supplies, including trauma kits and medications, to flood-affected communities in Ghor Province [1]. Furthermore, WHO plans to deploy additional Surveillance Support Teams (SSTs) to enhance active disease surveillance in the affected districts [4], and efforts are underway to ensure the provision of medicines, medical supplies, and consumables to health facilities serving the affected population in Ghor for the next three months [5].

**Question:**  What are the outcomes of the three-day training on minimum standards conducted by the Health Cluster, and how are these standards being applied in the current flood response?
**Answer:** The Health Cluster organized a three-day training on minimum standards in two batches: the first from April 28-30 and the second from April 29-May 01 [4]. This training was a collaborative effort with the AAP Working Group, Gender in Humanitarian Action (GiHA) Working Group, Disability Inclusion Working Group (DIWG), Protection Cluster, and the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) network, aiming to enhance humanitarian response standards [4].

The provided sources do not explicitly detail the specific outcomes of this training or how these standards are being applied in the current flood response.

**Question:**  How is the deployment of Surveillance Support Teams (SSTs) by WHO enhancing disease surveillance and response to potential outbreaks in flood-affected districts?
**Answer:** WHO plans to deploy additional Surveillance Support Teams (SSTs) to enhance active disease surveillance in the affected districts [1]. This deployment will allow for early detection and timely response to potential outbreaks of communicable diseases, especially waterborne illnesses [1].

**Question:**  What are the key protection risks identified in Afghanistan's flood-affected areas, and how are these risks impacting vulnerable groups such as women, girls, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and persons with disabilities?
**Answer:** Key protection risks identified in Afghanistan's flood-affected areas include protracted displacement, mine and explosive ordnance contamination, discrimination, and denial of access to services, resources, and humanitarian assistance [3]. Other risks are restrictions to freedom of movement, a growing threat of forced evictions, increased risks of gender-based violence (GBV), child labour, and early marriage [3]. There are also heightened needs for mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) [3][7][9], psychological first aid (PFA) [1], and concerns regarding civil documentation [1][3][9].

These risks contribute to a shrinking protection space [3]. They particularly affect women, girls, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees, persons living with disabilities, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups [3]. Protection partners are mobilizing resources to address specific needs such as MHPSS and legal assistance for vulnerable groups [7].

**Question:**  What measures are being taken to prevent cholera outbreaks in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Afghanistan, and how are governance structures of IDP communities involved in these efforts?
**Answer:** The primary focus of a meeting was to discuss flood and cholera prevention measures and find solutions to challenges arising from these issues [1][2]. The level of destruction significantly impacts the overall living conditions and hygiene within IDP camps and brings a significant risk of cholera outbreak [1][2]. Representatives and governance structures of IDP communities are involved by providing detailed information on flood-related damage to households and latrines in multiple IDP sites [1][2]. The provided sources do not specify the exact measures being taken to prevent cholera outbreaks in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Afghanistan.

**Question:**  What are the key protection risks identified for vulnerable groups in Afghanistan, and what immediate actions are being taken to address issues such as gender-based violence (GBV), child labor, and mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS)?
**Answer:** Widespread protection risks persist in Afghanistan, characterized by significant protracted displacement, mine and explosive ordnance contamination, discrimination, denial of access to services, resources and humanitarian assistance, restrictions to freedom of movement, growing threat of forced evictions, increased risks of gender-based violence (GBV), child labour, early marriage, and heightened needs for mental health and psychosocial support [1]. These risks particularly affect women, girls, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees, persons living with disabilities, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups [1].

To address these issues:
*   **Gender-Based Violence (GBV):** Mobile response teams are being mobilized to address a spectrum of protection needs, including support for GBV [3].
*   **Child Labor:** The provided sources do not contain information on immediate actions being taken specifically to address child labor.
*   **Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS):** Key concerns include mental health and psychological distress, and psychological first aid (PFA) [2]. Critical priority activities identified include psychosocial support, group and individual therapy sessions, training for caretakers and community leaders on life skills, and mental health and psychosocial support services [2]. Protection Cluster partners are actively delivering psychological support services, positive parenting, resources on individual therapy for resilience, awareness and counselling sessions, and community dialogue [2]. Thirteen mobile response teams are being mobilized in Ghor, Herat, and Badghis provinces to provide Mental Health and Psychosocial Support and Psychological First Aid [3]. Protection partners are mobilizing resources for a joint assessment of emerging protection needs, with data used to address specific needs such as MHPSS [5]. MHPSS continues to be identified as a primary protection concern, and special attention is given to it in rapid needs assessments [9]. It is essential to include at least one female health worker or female psychosocial counselor in each response team [11].

## SDG 4 - Quality Education

**Question:**  **Education Disruption:** How has the flooding impacted educational services in Baghlan province, and what steps are being taken to resume education for affected children?
**Answer:** The flooding has impacted educational services in Baghlan province, with 23 public schools affected [1] and 23 public schools and 21 Community-Based Education (CBE) classes destroyed [5]. Additionally, 23 schools were impacted [11].

To resume education for affected children, UNICEF is taking several steps:
*   UNICEF will provide an additional 78 High-Performance Tents (HPTs), 161 floormats, 80 whiteboards and markers, 137 teacher kits, and 227 student kits to 23 public schools in four districts of Baghlan province [1].
*   UNICEF has supported three flood-affected CBEs, enabling children to resume their learning in the most flood-affected districts [1]. These classes accommodate 85 children (45 girls and 40 boys) in Sheikh Jalal and Karkar villages in Baghlani Jadid and Puli Khumri districts [1].
*   UNICEF has dispatched 20 HPTs and 200 floormats for use in CBE classes [10].
*   Essential supplies, including floor mats, teaching and learning materials, and High-Performance Tents, are being provided to allow educational services to resume [11].
*   180 children, 50 percent of whom are girls, are attending three child-friendly spaces (CFS) integrated with CBE classes [23].

## SDG 5 - Gender Equality

Other risks are restrictions to freedom of movement, a growing threat of forced evictions, increased risks of gender-based violence (GBV), child labour, and early marriage [3]. There are also heightened needs for mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) [3][7][9], psychological first aid (PFA) [1], and concerns regarding civil documentation [1][3][9].

These risks contribute to a shrinking protection space [3]. They particularly affect women, girls, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees, persons living with disabilities, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups [3]. Protection partners are mobilizing resources to address specific needs such as MHPSS and legal assistance for vulnerable groups [7].

**Question:**  What are the key protection risks identified for vulnerable groups in Afghanistan, and what immediate actions are being taken to address issues such as gender-based violence (GBV), child labor, and mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS)?
**Answer:** Widespread protection risks persist in Afghanistan, characterized by significant protracted displacement, mine and explosive ordnance contamination, discrimination, denial of access to services, resources and humanitarian assistance, restrictions to freedom of movement, growing threat of forced evictions, increased risks of gender-based violence (GBV), child labour, early marriage, and heightened needs for mental health and psychosocial support [1]. These risks particularly affect women, girls, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees, persons living with disabilities, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups [1].

To address these issues:
*   **Gender-Based Violence (GBV):** Mobile response teams are being mobilized to address a spectrum of protection needs, including support for GBV [3].
*   **Child Labor:** The provided sources do not contain information on immediate actions being taken specifically to address child labor.
*   **Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS):** Key concerns include mental health and psychological distress, and psychological first aid (PFA) [2]. Critical priority activities identified include psychosocial support, group and individual therapy sessions, training for caretakers and community leaders on life skills, and mental health and psychosocial support services [2]. Protection Cluster partners are actively delivering psychological support services, positive parenting, resources on individual therapy for resilience, awareness and counselling sessions, and community dialogue [2]. Thirteen mobile response teams are being mobilized in Ghor, Herat, and Badghis provinces to provide Mental Health and Psychosocial Support and Psychological First Aid [3]. Protection partners are mobilizing resources for a joint assessment of emerging protection needs, with data used to address specific needs such as MHPSS [5]. MHPSS continues to be identified as a primary protection concern, and special attention is given to it in rapid needs assessments [9]. It is essential to include at least one female health worker or female psychosocial counselor in each response team [11].

## SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation

**Question:**  **Emergency Response:** What immediate interventions are UNICEF Emergency Response Teams implementing in the flood-affected areas, and what essential supplies are being provided?
**Answer:** UNICEF Emergency Response Teams are on the ground supporting ongoing interventions in the flood-affected areas [1]. These interventions include water trucking [1][6][10] and the provision of essential supplies [1][6][10]. The essential supplies provided include hygiene kits [1][6][10], family kits [1][6][10], blankets [1][6][10], tarpaulins [1][6][10], floor mats [1], teaching and learning materials [1], High-Performance Tents to allow educational services to resume [1], and multi-purpose cash [6][10].

**Question:**  What specific additional resources are urgently needed to replenish emergency stockpiles in Afghanistan, and how can these resources be mobilized effectively to support flood-affected communities?
**Answer:** Additional resources urgently required to replenish emergency stockpiles in Afghanistan include tents, Non-Food Items (NFIs), emergency shelter repair tool kits, and plastic tarpaulin [12]. Further prepositioning and mobilization of medical supplies and resources are needed to alleviate the suffering of flood-affected communities [10]. Mobilization efforts face challenges due to road damages and the destruction of main roads and bridges, which hinder the transportation of essential supplies and isolate communities [8][13][15]. To effectively support these communities, alternative transportation methods are necessary to reach isolated areas [15]. Additionally, enhancing collaboration among partners is crucial for a more coordinated and effective response, involving improved information sharing, coordinated activities, and leveraging each partner's strengths to maximize impact, leading to better resource allocation and reduced duplication of efforts [9].

**Question:**  What measures are being taken to prevent cholera outbreaks in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Afghanistan, and how are governance structures of IDP communities involved in these efforts?
**Answer:** The primary focus of a meeting was to discuss flood and cholera prevention measures and find solutions to challenges arising from these issues [1][2]. The level of destruction significantly impacts the overall living conditions and hygiene within IDP camps and brings a significant risk of cholera outbreak [1][2]. Representatives and governance structures of IDP communities are involved by providing detailed information on flood-related damage to households and latrines in multiple IDP sites [1][2]. The provided sources do not specify the exact measures being taken to prevent cholera outbreaks in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Afghanistan.

**Question:**  How is the World Food Programme (WFP) responding to the recent floods in Afghanistan, and what are the immediate and long-term strategies being implemented to support affected communities?
**Answer:** The World Food Programme (WFP) is responding to the recent floods in Afghanistan with both immediate and long-term strategies [1][2][5][10][12].

**Immediate Response:**
WFP activated its contingency response plan, triggered by its early warning system, and prepositioned food stocks in Herat and Mazar ahead of the rains [5][8]. WFP's area office mobilized within three hours of the floods to dispatch and distribute fortified biscuits and lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) for blanket distribution in all affected locations [10]. Immediate distributions to accessible affected households included high-energy biscuits, nutritional supplements, and subsidized bread rations [5][10]. Blanket food assistance has been distributed to affected populations in all currently accessible areas [4]. By the end of last week, WFP started providing food rations and cash assistance where markets were functional [12]. From May 15, WFP initiated multi-purpose cash assistance of AFN 6,400 (USD 87.7) to flood-affected populations, collaborating with partners on joint distributions [4]. WFP is also erecting and replacing rub-halls (mobile storage units) to serve as hubs, setting up new rub-halls for storage, and sending food trucks to a second hub [4]. Joint Assessment teams are in the field reporting on priority locations, scale, and impact [8].

**Long-term Strategies:**
Following initial distributions, WFP plans to provide food and nutrition assistance with a 100 percent ration for two months, followed by a reduced distribution at 50 percent for the remaining four months [5][10]. Resilience activities will be incorporated into the recovery program, targeting affected communities to mediate further loss [10]. WFP has called for an additional $14.5 million to assist flood-affected people with "emergency food and nutrition assistance and resilience-building projects" [2]. WFP is investing in climate adaptation projects, designed and built by communities, to shield them from the impacts of the climate crisis, including protective walls, dams, and irrigation canals [12].

## SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth

**Question:** What impact has the stable exchange rate of the Afghani (AFN) against the US Dollar (USD) had on the purchasing power of humanitarian cash assistance in Afghanistan?
**Answer:** The appreciation of the Afghani (AFN) against the US Dollar (USD), which has led to the AFN remaining relatively stable between AFN 70 and AFN 74 per USD since November 2023 [1][9], has been credited as a factor contributing to persistent deflation [8].

**Question:**  What are the specific challenges faced by families like Hanifa's in Behsood e Markazi district during the winter, and how is cash distribution being utilized to address these challenges?
**Answer:** Families like Hanifa's in the Behsood e Markazi district face a dire economic situation due to a lack of job opportunities for women [1] and significant challenges coping with the harsh winter [1]. Her son, who is the family's caretaker, can only work for approximately three to four months a year, which must sustain them through the entire winter [2]. During winter, he is unemployed, and the family relies on support from relief agencies and other villagers [5]. Most residents in this remote, mountainous district live below the poverty line and lack access to basic needs [5]. Despite owning agricultural plots, they struggle to afford basic winter necessities due to limited opportunities and long winters that prevent them from earning sufficient incomes [5]. Hanifa's 90-year-old mother-in-law is gravely ill and requires a warm room and winter clothes [2].

Cash distribution is utilized to address these challenges by providing emergency support for winterisation needs [2]. People in Need, with funding from the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, distributed cash for winterisation assistance to nearly 13,000 people in 51 villages and 6 districts in Maidan Wardak, Central Afghanistan [2]. Hanifa's family received cash after their home was surveyed and their financial situation and challenges, including her mother-in-law's need for a warm room and winter clothes, were assessed [2]. The World Food Programme (WFP) also initiated multi-purpose cash assistance (AFN 6,400 / USD 87.7) to flood-affected populations, designed to complement the average income of Afghani households and enable them to meet their essential needs [8]. WFP provides cash assistance in areas where markets are functional [17].

## SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure

**Question:**  What specific challenges are humanitarian organizations facing in delivering aid to the flood-affected regions, particularly in terms of infrastructure and accessibility?
**Answer:** Humanitarian organizations are facing significant challenges in delivering aid due to extensive damage to infrastructure and resulting accessibility issues [1][2][4][6][9][11][12][13][14][16][18].

Specific challenges include:
*   **Damaged Infrastructure:** Roads and bridges have sustained extensive damage [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][9][11][12][14][15][17][18]. In Baghlan Province, 50 bridges and 30 electricity dams were damaged [18].
*   **Inaccessibility:** Many locations remain inaccessible for humanitarian teams [2], with flooding disrupting accessibility to affected areas [4]. Challenging terrains, landslides, and flooded roads have hampered relief operations [1]. Blocked roads [11] and significant physical access issues on several roads and thoroughfares, particularly in Guzargah Noor, Khost, and Jelga districts in Baghlan province, have made certain areas like Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak inaccessible by road [12][13][16]. Some roads in the Northeast have also been rendered inaccessible, slowing down joint assessment teams [18].
*   **Hampered Aid Delivery:** The destroyed infrastructure has hampered aid delivery [6][9] and efforts to reach areas in need [1]. This has caused delays in the initial days of the response [11], leading relief organizations to struggle in delivering aid to affected people [10].

**Question:**  What is the current status of search and rescue operations in the regions affected by the floods, and what are the main obstacles hindering these efforts?
**Answer:** Search and rescue operations are ongoing [1][2][3][4][11], with concerns about people trapped under collapsed buildings or structures [1][2][3][4]. Hundreds have been reported to be trapped in their homes beneath mud [4].

The main obstacles hindering these efforts include challenging terrains and damaged infrastructure, such as roads and bridges [5][8][18]. Many locations remain inaccessible for humanitarian teams [8][10][12][14], which has hampered relief operations and aid delivery [5][9][12]. Safety concerns and blocked roads also posed initial challenges [14].

**Question:**  What is the current status of the infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, in the affected provinces, and how is this impacting the delivery of humanitarian aid?
**Answer:** Large scale infrastructure damage is reported, including structural damage to vital bridges and roads [1]. Extensive damage has occurred to roads and bridges [2], with 50 bridges damaged in Baghlan Province [4]. Public infrastructure has been critically impacted, including damage and temporary closure of the Ghor-Herat highway [3]. Roads, bridges, health facilities, and public schools have sustained damage and destruction [6].

This damage has significantly impacted humanitarian aid delivery and access. Many locations remain inaccessible for humanitarian teams [1]. Challenging terrains and damaged infrastructure have hampered relief operations and efforts to reach areas in need of assistance [2]. Some roads across all three provinces in the Northeast have been rendered inaccessible, slowing down joint assessment teams [4]. Several roads and thoroughfares, particularly in Guzargah Noor, Khost, and Jelga districts in Baghlan province, have resulted in significant physical access issues [6]. Blocked roads caused initial challenges and delays in the first days of the response [8]. Certain areas like Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak remain inaccessible by road due to the damage caused by flooding [9][10][12][17]. Overall, destroyed infrastructure has hampered aid delivery and efforts to find the missing [13], and flooding has disrupted accessibility to affected areas [15].

**Question:**  What challenges are humanitarian partners facing in reaching vulnerable populations in flood-affected districts due to road damages, and what alternative transportation methods are being considered to overcome these challenges?
**Answer:** Humanitarian partners face challenges in reaching vulnerable populations in flood-affected districts due to road damages [1]. Essential supplies cannot be transported through the road network in Guzargahe Noor district, Baghlan province [1]. WHO and Health Cluster partners have difficulties reaching affected populations due to severe damage to transportation infrastructure, including roads and bridges [6]. This results in isolated communities, and movement between villages is hindered by flowing rivers [6]. Additionally, the blockade of the Herat to Ghor road is hindering the delivery of emergency supplies from Herat [6]. The destruction of main roads and bridges necessitates alternative transportation methods to reach isolated areas [7].

## SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities

**Question:** What impact has the stable exchange rate of the Afghani (AFN) against the US Dollar (USD) had on the purchasing power of humanitarian cash assistance in Afghanistan?
**Answer:** The appreciation of the Afghani (AFN) against the US Dollar (USD), which has led to the AFN remaining relatively stable between AFN 70 and AFN 74 per USD since November 2023 [1][9], has been credited as a factor contributing to persistent deflation [8].

**Question:**  What are the key protection risks identified in Afghanistan's flood-affected areas, and how are these risks impacting vulnerable groups such as women, girls, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and persons with disabilities?
**Answer:** Key protection risks identified in Afghanistan's flood-affected areas include protracted displacement, mine and explosive ordnance contamination, discrimination, and denial of access to services, resources, and humanitarian assistance [3]. Other risks are restrictions to freedom of movement, a growing threat of forced evictions, increased risks of gender-based violence (GBV), child labour, and early marriage [3]. There are also heightened needs for mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) [3][7][9], psychological first aid (PFA) [1], and concerns regarding civil documentation [1][3][9].

These risks contribute to a shrinking protection space [3]. They particularly affect women, girls, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees, persons living with disabilities, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups [3]. Protection partners are mobilizing resources to address specific needs such as MHPSS and legal assistance for vulnerable groups [7].

**Question:**  How is the Early Warning Information Working Group (EWIWG) addressing the forecasted below-average precipitation and above-average temperatures in Afghanistan, and what measures are being taken to mitigate potential impacts on agriculture and food security?
**Answer:** The Early Warning Information Working Group (EWIWG) addresses forecasted weather patterns by delivering comprehensive presentations on early warning information to cluster partners [5][6][7][8]. These presentations include details on precipitation forecasts, such as rainfall for the 2023-24 winter wet season (October 2023 to March 2024) being most likely below average [6][8]. However, for January 2023 to March 2024, there was a likely chance of above-average precipitation in most of Afghanistan [5][7], though rainfall analysis since November 1 shows below-average precipitation [5]. Between December 2023 and January 2024, the country experienced below-average precipitation, but February had significant precipitation [7]. Average precipitation is most likely from March to May 2024 [6][8]. Regarding temperatures, above-average temperatures were forecasted for the whole year [3], and unseasonably warm temperatures have contributed to floods [1]. As of March 15, 2024, snowpack is below average throughout the country [15]. The provided sources do not detail specific measures taken by the EWIWG to mitigate potential impacts on agriculture and food security beyond presenting this early warning information.

## SDG 16 - Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions

**Question:** What methodologies are being used by the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) Afghanistan to quantify and understand mobility dynamics at Afghanistan's borders?
**Answer:** DTM Afghanistan's Flow Monitoring activity uses two interlinked exercises to quantify and understand mobility dynamics at Afghanistan's borders [1]. The first exercise is Flow Monitoring Counting (FMC), which is a headcount of all individuals entering or leaving Afghanistan, including returnees, to gauge flow volume [1]. The second exercise is the Flow Monitoring Survey (FMS), which involves surveying randomly selected Afghan national individuals or groups entering or leaving Afghanistan to understand their profiles, motivations, and vulnerabilities [1]. DTM began deploying field teams for these activities at four border crossing points with Iran and Pakistan on January 10, 2024, and expanded to Ghulam Khan as of February 11 [1].

**Question:**  **Coordination and Preparedness:** How is the Border Consortium coordinating with IOM and UNHCR to monitor and respond to the increased returnee flow, and what preparedness plans are in place to address potential future surges?
**Answer:** The Border Consortium continues to monitor the situation in coordination with IOM and UNHCR Pakistan, and will promptly relay confirmed updates [1][5]. To address potential future surges, the Border Consortium is actively working with partners on preparedness plans [1][5]. They have reviewed their contingency plan for the Pakistan border and worked with regional Consortium coordination groups to assess partners' capacity to maintain or scale up their operations as required [1]. The Consortium also updated its 2023-2024 Border appeal and engages with partners and donors to anticipate gaps and ensure adequate resources are available in case of a renewed influx [7]. Consortium Partners have progressively scaled up and adjusted operations at both Spin Boldak and Torkham Border Points to respond to the significant increased returns since mid-September 2023 [7].

**Question:**  **Child Protection:** What are the preliminary findings of the Child Protection Area of Responsibility rapid assessment, and how many children are identified as needing protection services?
**Answer:** Preliminary results from the Child Protection Area of Responsibility (CPAoR) rapid assessment show that 554 children are in need of child protection services [1][2]. Of these, 290 are girls and 264 are boys [1][2].

**Question:**  What measures are being taken to prevent cholera outbreaks in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Afghanistan, and how are governance structures of IDP communities involved in these efforts?
**Answer:** The primary focus of a meeting was to discuss flood and cholera prevention measures and find solutions to challenges arising from these issues [1][2]. The level of destruction significantly impacts the overall living conditions and hygiene within IDP camps and brings a significant risk of cholera outbreak [1][2]. Representatives and governance structures of IDP communities are involved by providing detailed information on flood-related damage to households and latrines in multiple IDP sites [1][2]. The provided sources do not specify the exact measures being taken to prevent cholera outbreaks in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Afghanistan.

**Question:**  What are the key protection risks identified for vulnerable groups in Afghanistan, and what immediate actions are being taken to address issues such as gender-based violence (GBV), child labor, and mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS)?
**Answer:** Widespread protection risks persist in Afghanistan, characterized by significant protracted displacement, mine and explosive ordnance contamination, discrimination, denial of access to services, resources and humanitarian assistance, restrictions to freedom of movement, growing threat of forced evictions, increased risks of gender-based violence (GBV), child labour, early marriage, and heightened needs for mental health and psychosocial support [1]. These risks particularly affect women, girls, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees, persons living with disabilities, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups [1].

To address these issues:
*   **Gender-Based Violence (GBV):** Mobile response teams are being mobilized to address a spectrum of protection needs, including support for GBV [3].
*   **Child Labor:** The provided sources do not contain information on immediate actions being taken specifically to address child labor.
*   **Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS):** Key concerns include mental health and psychological distress, and psychological first aid (PFA) [2]. Critical priority activities identified include psychosocial support, group and individual therapy sessions, training for caretakers and community leaders on life skills, and mental health and psychosocial support services [2]. Protection Cluster partners are actively delivering psychological support services, positive parenting, resources on individual therapy for resilience, awareness and counselling sessions, and community dialogue [2]. Thirteen mobile response teams are being mobilized in Ghor, Herat, and Badghis provinces to provide Mental Health and Psychosocial Support and Psychological First Aid [3]. Protection partners are mobilizing resources for a joint assessment of emerging protection needs, with data used to address specific needs such as MHPSS [5]. MHPSS continues to be identified as a primary protection concern, and special attention is given to it in rapid needs assessments [9]. It is essential to include at least one female health worker or female psychosocial counselor in each response team [11].

## SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals

**Question:**  **Coordination and Preparedness:** How is the Border Consortium coordinating with IOM and UNHCR to monitor and respond to the increased returnee flow, and what preparedness plans are in place to address potential future surges?
**Answer:** The Border Consortium continues to monitor the situation in coordination with IOM and UNHCR Pakistan, and will promptly relay confirmed updates [1][5]. To address potential future surges, the Border Consortium is actively working with partners on preparedness plans [1][5]. They have reviewed their contingency plan for the Pakistan border and worked with regional Consortium coordination groups to assess partners' capacity to maintain or scale up their operations as required [1]. The Consortium also updated its 2023-2024 Border appeal and engages with partners and donors to anticipate gaps and ensure adequate resources are available in case of a renewed influx [7]. Consortium Partners have progressively scaled up and adjusted operations at both Spin Boldak and Torkham Border Points to respond to the significant increased returns since mid-September 2023 [7].

**Question:**  What specific additional resources are urgently needed to replenish emergency stockpiles in Afghanistan, and how can these resources be mobilized effectively to support flood-affected communities?
**Answer:** Additional resources urgently required to replenish emergency stockpiles in Afghanistan include tents, Non-Food Items (NFIs), emergency shelter repair tool kits, and plastic tarpaulin [12]. Further prepositioning and mobilization of medical supplies and resources are needed to alleviate the suffering of flood-affected communities [10]. Mobilization efforts face challenges due to road damages and the destruction of main roads and bridges, which hinder the transportation of essential supplies and isolate communities [8][13][15]. To effectively support these communities, alternative transportation methods are necessary to reach isolated areas [15]. Additionally, enhancing collaboration among partners is crucial for a more coordinated and effective response, involving improved information sharing, coordinated activities, and leveraging each partner's strengths to maximize impact, leading to better resource allocation and reduced duplication of efforts [9].

**Question:**  How is the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) planning to support flood-affected people in specific districts, and what coordination efforts are being made to ensure effective response and support?
**Answer:** FSAC partners plan to reach flood-affected people in the districts of Maimana, Qaysar, Almar, Dawlat Abad, Bilcheragh, Gurziwan, Pashtun Kot, Khwaja Sabz Posh, Ferozkoh, Charsada, Pasaband, Shahrak, Tolak, and Saghar [1]. To ensure effective response and support, a regional FSAC team will be deployed to provide coordination and response support once the road from Hirat to Ghor is reopened [1].
