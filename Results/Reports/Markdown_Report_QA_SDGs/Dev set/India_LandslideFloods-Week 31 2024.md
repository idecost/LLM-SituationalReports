# India_LandslideFloods-Week 31 2024

## Summary
India is grappling with severe natural calamities, primarily devastating landslides and heavy rainfall in Kerala's Wayanad district since the early hours of July 30th, alongside heavy rains impacting Delhi and the National Capital Region on August 1st[49]. In Wayanad, devastating landslides have resulted in at least 358 deaths and over 200 missing persons as of August 3rd, with earlier reports indicating 270 lives claimed and 378 missing by July 31st[92]. Thousands have been displaced, with over 11,000 individuals housed in 106 relief camps across Kerala[52]. The disaster has destroyed critical infrastructure, including a main bridge and hundreds of buildings, isolating many families and causing power outages[69]. Rescue operations are actively underway, involving the KSDMA, NDRF, army, police, and volunteers, utilizing helicopters, drones, and sniffer dogs, though efforts are challenged by continued heavy rains and blocked roads[34]. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued red alerts for extremely heavy rainfall in several Kerala districts, forecasting continued heavy showers[49]. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed distress and announced compensation for victims' families, while the Kerala government declared a state of mourning[1][57]. Experts attribute the increased frequency of such events to erratic monsoon patterns, climate change, and rapid, ecologically insensitive construction in the Western Ghats, emphasizing the urgent need for comprehensive action plans and improved early warning systems[42].

**Answer:** To ensure the safety and well-being of residents amid ongoing heavy rains and landslides, several measures are being taken by authorities in Wayanad and the broader Kerala state:

India's weather department has put Kerala on alert [1][2]. Authorities closed schools in some parts on Tuesday [1][2][5][7]. Yellow alerts for heavy rain are in effect over Wayanad district [13]. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan urged the public to follow instructions given by authorities [3][4].

A massive rescue operation is underway in the northeastern district of Wayanad [8], with efforts being made to rescue people [6][8] and helicopters brought to the area [8]. The government is ensuring food delivery and essential items to relief camps [12].

Humanitarian response efforts include IAG Wayanad monitoring the situation regularly, supporting rescue operations, and coordinating relief activities [10]. An IAG meeting was scheduled to assess the situation and enhance coordination efforts [10].

**Question:** How have recent natural disasters in India, described as some of the worst seen, affected local communities and what immediate relief efforts are necessary ?
**Answer:** Recent natural disasters in India, described as some of the worst natural calamities the state has seen [5], have included fatal floods and landslides [1][4]. The country has witnessed an alarming rise in landslides in recent years [2][3][5]. While a comprehensive action plan is considered the need of the hour to address the growing frequency of natural calamities [2][3][5], the provided sources do not specify immediate relief efforts.

**Question:** What additional resources or support are needed to enhance the ongoing search and rescue operations in Kerala ?
**Answer:** To enhance ongoing search and rescue operations in Kerala, additional resources and support are needed, including drones to understand the situation of isolated areas [1][9], and freezers to store unidentified dead bodies, as a shortage has been reported [1][9]. Furthermore, the implementation of effective early warning systems is a vital component of disaster management [2], with significant gaps remaining [4], and a need to prepare targeted early warning systems to save lives and livelihoods [4]. Urgent mitigation measures also need to be implemented [8], and a comprehensive action plan is required to address the growing frequency of natural calamities [5].

**Question:** How is the predicted rainfall over the next 36 hours expected to impact ongoing rescue operations and the stability of the affected areas ?
**Answer:** A possibility of heavy rains is forecast for the next 36 hours [3][7], with more rain predicted throughout the day [4][15]. Light to moderate rainfall, with occasional intense to very intense showers, isolated thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds, is also likely over Kerala in the next 03 hours [10]. Incessant rains and adverse weather conditions have already prevented planned visits to the disaster site due to an inability to land [9].

**Question:** What are the current challenges faced by the rescue teams in Kerala in accessing and evacuating affected areas ?
**Answer:** Rescue teams in Kerala face several challenges in accessing and evacuating affected areas. A main crossing linking the affected area was destroyed by landslides [1], and vehicles have been swept off roads and are stuck in a swollen river [1]. This necessitates the construction of a temporary bridge [1][2] and the evacuation of individuals by helicopter [2]. Incessant rains and adverse weather conditions have also prevented landing in the disaster area [5]. Furthermore, there is difficulty in understanding the situation in isolated areas, leading to requests for drones [2][8]. Swollen rivers and rivulets also pose a risk [11]. More rain is predicted throughout the day [1][6], with a possibility of heavy rains in the next 36 hours [11]. Timely evacuation measures are often lacking [3].
