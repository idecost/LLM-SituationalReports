# Bangladesh_Cyclone Remal-Week 21 2024

## Summary
Bangladesh is currently facing the severe threat of Cyclone Remal, which was expected to make landfall by midnight on May 26th, 2024, near Sagar Island, India and Khepupara, Bangladesh, with maximum wind speeds of 110-120 km/hr and gusts up to 135 km/hr[48][70]. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department has issued Great Danger Signal No. 10 for coastal districts like Mongla, Payra, Khulna, Satkhira, Barguna, Patuakhali, and Bhola, warning of potential floods, flash floods, landslides, and a storm surge up to 12 feet[72][74]. This storm threatens an exposed population of 11 million people[70], including 1.3 million vulnerable individuals[34], and exacerbates existing challenges for coastal communities, many of whom are still recovering from recent heatwaves and fires[77]. The situation is further complicated by a recent fire in B3 Camp-13, which displaced 4,000 people who now require shelter, food, and water as the cyclone approaches[73]. In response, nearly a million people are fleeing inland to concrete storm shelters[67], with 4,000 cyclone shelters prepared for evacuation[11], and organizations like the World Food Programme (WFP) have dispatched anticipatory cash assistance to over 30,000 at-risk families (150,000 people) in Khulna and Barishal Divisions to aid in preparation and recovery[63]. World Vision Bangladesh is also mobilizing to assist fire survivors and prepare for the storm's impact, prioritizing the safety and well-being of affected children and communities[73].

## SDG 1 - No Poverty

**Question:**  What are the challenges faced by Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar regarding health and living conditions, as described in the text?
**Answer:** Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar face inhumane living conditions [1][5], with no investment in their living conditions or education [1]. The situation is dire [2], and conditions in the camps are deteriorating [2][3]. They are vulnerable to extreme weather events like cyclones and landslides [2], and climate-induced hazards such as floods and cyclones pose additional threats, leading to internal displacement [6]. There have also been fires in refugee camps [4], including an instance where an LPG gas canister exploded in a hut, setting it on fire [10].

Regarding health, there are a multitude of outbreaks in the camps [4], including diphtheria, cholera, measles, COVID-19, scabies, and dengue [4][7][11]. Skin diseases like dengue, eczema, and scabies are spreading rapidly due to waste around the camps [7].

**Question:**  What specific actions are being taken by World Vision Bangladesh to support vulnerable children and communities affected by Cyclone Remal?

**Question:**  How is the Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) analyzing the projected impact of Cyclone Remal, and what are the key findings of their impact analysis?
**Answer:** The Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) has undertaken an impact analysis of the projected impact of Cyclone Remal [1]. NAWG functions as a platform for government and non-government humanitarian agencies under the Humanitarian Coordination Task Team (HCTT) [3][4], with its secretariat hosted by CARE Bangladesh under the "Supporting Bangladesh Rapid Needs Assessment SUBARNA III Project" [3]. NAWG does not generate or develop information; instead, it compiles and interpolates information from sources such as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) for its reports [10][12]. These reports are intended for internal use by NAWG Bangladesh Members for preparatory activities and are not official information of the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) [10][12].

Key findings from their impact analysis include:
*   Up to 1.9 million people are at risk [1].
*   An exposed population of 11 million people in areas with 110-120 km/hr wind speeds [2].
*   Projected maximum wind speeds are 55-56 km/h gusting to 65 km/h on May 25, 110-120 km/h gusting to 130 km/h on May 26, and 50-60 km/h gusting to 70 km/h on May 27 [4].

**Question:**  What is the role of the Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) in analyzing the impact of Cyclone Remal, and what are their findings regarding the number of people at risk?
**Answer:** The Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) is a platform for government and non-government humanitarian agencies under the Humanitarian Coordination Task Team (HCTT) [8][10]. NAWG undertakes an impact analysis of the projected impact of the cyclone [1] and conducts anticipatory impact analysis [3]. It compiles and interpolates information from different sources, such as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD), for its reports, which are for internal use by NAWG Bangladesh Members for preparatory activities and are not official government information [12][13].

Regarding the number of people at risk, NAWG's impact analysis shows up to 1.9 million people at risk [1]. Additionally, an anticipatory impact analysis from NAWG indicates an exposed population of 11 million people [3].

**Question:**  What contingency partnerships does UNICEF have in place for a rapid response to Cyclone Remal in Bangladesh, and how many can be reprogrammed for emergency response?
**Answer:** UNICEF has three contingency partnerships with civil society organizations (CSOs) that are ready for activation for a rapid response in cyclone-affected areas [1][3]. Additionally, 19 partnerships can be reprogrammed in case of emergency response [1][3].

**Question:**  What items have families been able to procure with the cash assistance provided by WFP, and what additional measures have they taken to prepare for Cyclone Remal?
**Answer:** Families have been able to procure essential items such as food, medicines, and cattle feed with the cash assistance provided by WFP [2][3][4]. Additionally, some families have utilized the funds to reinforce their homes with ropes and arrange transportation for family members to safer locations [2][3][8].

**Question:**  What challenges are highlighted in the report regarding the global humanitarian funding crisis, and how do these challenges specifically impact the response to Cyclone Remal in Bangladesh?
**Answer:** The global humanitarian funding crisis is characterized by an elusive quick resolution [1] and a serious funding shortfall [3], leading to a "crisis within a crisis" [2][3]. This shortfall means that humanitarian organizations fell short of reaching their target in 2023, assisting less than two-thirds of the people they aimed to support [1]. Response plans for 2024 are ultra-prioritised with extremely tightened budgets [1].

The challenges include:
*   A widening gap between needs and response, exacerbated by conflicts, climate emergencies, and collapsing economies, which result in catastrophic hunger, massive displacement, and disease outbreaks [2].
*   The inability to deliver life-saving aid and essential services due to inadequate resources, which perpetuates cycles of suffering and worsens existing emergencies [4].
*   A reliance solely on humanitarian efforts that falls short in the long term [2].
*   The need for more flexible funding mechanisms, such as multi-year funding and reduced restrictions on fund allocation, to enhance the effectiveness of support [5].

The provided sources do not contain information on how these challenges specifically impact the response to Cyclone Remal in Bangladesh.

**Question:**  What measures can be taken to reduce the vulnerability of low-income households in Bangladesh to cyclones and other climate-related disasters?
**Answer:** Measures that can be taken to reduce the vulnerability of low-income households to cyclones and other climate-related disasters include:
*   **Poverty Reduction** Lifting people out of poverty is an essential solution to reducing climate risks [4]. International cooperation and support are needed to ensure the poorest and most vulnerable are not left behind [12].
*   **Infrastructure and Housing Improvements** Investing in infrastructure is vital [3]. This includes people living in better buildings [9] and upholding strict building standards [12].
*   **Access to Basic Resources** Providing access to electricity and clean water [2], and air conditioning or heating to protect from extreme temperatures [2][9].
*   **Early Warning Systems** Increasing the coverage of early warning systems helps reduce exposure [7]. Better weather prediction and early warning systems allow people to evacuate before a hazard hits [8]. Accurate forecasts and useful early warnings require data from all countries in a region to be brought together and fed into weather models [14].
*   **Agricultural Productivity** Making agriculture more productive is vital [3], as more productive agricultural systems can recover from damaging events [8].
*   **Financial Resilience** Ensuring households have enough money to absorb shocks in energy or food prices and resources to recover after a disaster [2].
*   **Strong Governance and Support** Building strong political governance is vital [3]. Political systems should allow for national and international support before or after a hazard strikes [9]. Populations pushing for political rights and accountability also contribute [12].
*   **Human Capital Development** Disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies can impact human capital investment, including providing schooling opportunities for households constrained by subsistence consumption [1].

**Question:**  What measures are being taken to address the impact of Cyclone Remal on the nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh?
**Answer:** To address the impact of Cyclone Remal, which poses a significant threat to the nearly 1 million Rohingya people in the world's largest refugee camp [2], the World Food Programme (WFP) provided 3,400 Rohingya refugees with fortified biscuits [2]. Additionally, ongoing needs assessments are being conducted to update and determine the extent of potential damage caused by the cyclone [2].

## SDG 2 - Zero Hunger

**Question:**  How does WFP's Anticipatory Action programme aim to prevent and mitigate the effects of extreme weather on food security and nutrition in Bangladesh?
**Answer:** WFP's Anticipatory Action (AA) programme aims to prevent and mitigate, to the extent possible, the effects of extreme weather on the food security and nutrition of highly vulnerable people [2][7]. It enables the implementation and financing of actions before an extreme weather event occurs [2][7].

To achieve this, WFP provides forecast-based cash assistance [1], which aids families in preparing for and recovering from impending storms [3][5]. This assistance allows families to procure essential items such as food, medicines, and cattle feed [3][5][9], and to reinforce their homes with ropes or arrange transportation for family members to safer locations [3][9]. The cash distribution is complemented by early warning messages and evacuation support, coordinated with local government authorities [9].

In Bangladesh, WFP, along with national and local government partners, supports the development of early-warning systems and anticipatory actions for critical natural hazards including floods, cyclones, flash floods, and heavy rainfall [2]. As part of anticipatory action initiatives, WFP finalizes beneficiary databases for flood-prone areas in the northeast and cyclone-prone areas in the southwestern regions [6]. WFP also coordinates closely with partners to check beneficiary databases and prevent duplication of AA beneficiaries [8]. Furthermore, WFP participates in Disaster Management Committee (DMC) meetings to ensure a coordinated approach to preparedness and response [8], and its cooperating partners assist Cyclone Shelter Management Committees (SMCs) [8]. WFP camp retailer partners maintain emergency stocks of food for rapid response [8], and WFP works to mitigate transport and telecommunications disruptions [8].

**Question:**  What measures are being taken to address the impact of Cyclone Remal on the nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh?
**Answer:** To address the impact of Cyclone Remal, which poses a significant threat to the nearly 1 million Rohingya people in the world's largest refugee camp [2], the World Food Programme (WFP) provided 3,400 Rohingya refugees with fortified biscuits [2]. Additionally, ongoing needs assessments are being conducted to update and determine the extent of potential damage caused by the cyclone [2].

## SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being

**Question:**  What are the challenges faced by Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar regarding health and living conditions, as described in the text?
**Answer:** Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar face inhumane living conditions [1][5], with no investment in their living conditions or education [1]. The situation is dire [2], and conditions in the camps are deteriorating [2][3]. They are vulnerable to extreme weather events like cyclones and landslides [2], and climate-induced hazards such as floods and cyclones pose additional threats, leading to internal displacement [6]. There have also been fires in refugee camps [4], including an instance where an LPG gas canister exploded in a hut, setting it on fire [10].

Regarding health, there are a multitude of outbreaks in the camps [4], including diphtheria, cholera, measles, COVID-19, scabies, and dengue [4][7][11]. Skin diseases like dengue, eczema, and scabies are spreading rapidly due to waste around the camps [7].

**Question:**  What are the health implications of using saline water for cooking, drinking, and bathing in Khulna, as highlighted by the case of Khatun's chronic kidney disease?
**Answer:** Residents in Khulna, particularly around the Notun Bazar area, regularly use saline water for cooking, drinking, and bathing [2]. The increasing salinisation of freshwater resources in the region is putting the health of local populations under greater threat [3], and this water crisis has become a major health hazard with deadly consequences [5].

Research has investigated the effects of water salinity on kidney health [1]. Findings suggest that drinking-water sodium and urinary sodium are associated with increased protein excretion [4], which is a powerful marker for kidney disease [4]. Elevated levels of protein in urine, specifically mild, moderate, or substantial proteinuria, were observed in trial participants [1].

Khatun was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [3][8], a serious, progressive disease involving a gradual loss of kidney function [8]. Her hands and feet became swollen [8]. Her kidneys had not been working properly for nearly seven years, and her heart, lungs, and central nervous system were already severely affected [9]. She also experienced high blood pressure, fatigue, achy muscles, and shortness of breath [9]. Since her diagnosis, her health has deteriorated [13], and she experiences intolerable pain [13]. She was told she needed to start dialysis immediately, up to three times a week [10][13]. An increase in kidney-related diseases is expected if water quality does not improve [7].

**Question:**  What are the health implications of water salinity and extreme heat on the population in Khulna, as outlined in the text?
**Answer:** The population in Khulna faces health implications from water salinity and extreme heat.

**Water Salinity:**
The water crisis, which includes a lack of suitable drinking water for rehydration, has become a major health hazard with deadly consequences [1]. Saline intrusion results in a shortage of clean and safe water [3], leading residents to regularly use saline water for cooking, drinking, and bathing [3]. The increasing salinisation of freshwater resources in the region is putting the health of local populations under greater threat [4]. Research in coastal areas of south-western Bangladesh, including Khulna, investigated the effects of water salinity on kidney health [2]. This research found that drinking-water sodium and urinary sodium are associated with increased protein excretion, which is a powerful marker for kidney disease [5]. Among 1,185 trial participants, 37 had mild proteinuria and 20 had moderate or substantial proteinuria [2]. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been diagnosed in Khulna, with one individual's kidneys not working properly for nearly seven years, severely affecting her heart, lungs, and central nervous system [4][6]. An increase in kidney-related diseases is expected if water quality does not improve [8].

**Extreme Heat:**
Extreme heat in Khulna resulted in a rise in hospital admissions, forcing patients to occupy corridors and stairways as wards ran out of beds [1]. High temperatures cause profound sweating, loss of body fluid, and dehydration [1]. Research linked ambient temperature data to participants' health outcomes, comparing the effects of extreme heat on kidney health [5]. Findings suggest that women in tropical regions are as susceptible to the effects of high ambient temperature exposure as men [4].

**Question:**  What are the health implications of using saline water for cooking, drinking, and bathing in Khulna, Bangladesh, especially in the aftermath of Cyclone Remal?
**Answer:** The use of saline water for cooking, drinking, and bathing in Khulna has become a major health hazard with deadly consequences [2][3]. Research has investigated the effects of water salinity on kidney health in coastal areas of south-western Bangladesh, including Khulna [1]. In one study, out of 1,185 trial participants from 532 households, 37 had mild proteinuria (elevated levels of protein in their urine) while 20 had moderate or substantial proteinuria [1]. Drinking-water sodium and urinary sodium are associated with increased protein excretion, which is a powerful marker for kidney disease [9]. The increasing salinisation of freshwater resources in the region is putting the health of local populations under greater threat [4]. An increase in kidney-related diseases is expected if water quality does not improve [8].

*   World Vision works to assess needs and provide critical aid [2], and has formed a rapid assessment team to evaluate the damage and immediate needs [11].
*   World Vision BRCR's Child Protection Team provided foster care services and reunified 3 missing children with their families [3].

**Question:**  How is the Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) analyzing the projected impact of Cyclone Remal, and what are the key findings of their impact analysis?
**Answer:** The Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) has undertaken an impact analysis of the projected impact of Cyclone Remal [1]. NAWG functions as a platform for government and non-government humanitarian agencies under the Humanitarian Coordination Task Team (HCTT) [3][4], with its secretariat hosted by CARE Bangladesh under the "Supporting Bangladesh Rapid Needs Assessment SUBARNA III Project" [3]. NAWG does not generate or develop information; instead, it compiles and interpolates information from sources such as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) for its reports [10][12]. These reports are intended for internal use by NAWG Bangladesh Members for preparatory activities and are not official information of the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) [10][12].

Key findings from their impact analysis include:
*   Up to 1.9 million people are at risk [1].
*   An exposed population of 11 million people in areas with 110-120 km/hr wind speeds [2].
*   Projected maximum wind speeds are 55-56 km/h gusting to 65 km/h on May 25, 110-120 km/h gusting to 130 km/h on May 26, and 50-60 km/h gusting to 70 km/h on May 27 [4].

**Question:**  What is the role of the Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) in analyzing the impact of Cyclone Remal, and what are their findings regarding the number of people at risk?
**Answer:** The Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) is a platform for government and non-government humanitarian agencies under the Humanitarian Coordination Task Team (HCTT) [8][10]. NAWG undertakes an impact analysis of the projected impact of the cyclone [1] and conducts anticipatory impact analysis [3]. It compiles and interpolates information from different sources, such as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD), for its reports, which are for internal use by NAWG Bangladesh Members for preparatory activities and are not official government information [12][13].

Regarding the number of people at risk, NAWG's impact analysis shows up to 1.9 million people at risk [1]. Additionally, an anticipatory impact analysis from NAWG indicates an exposed population of 11 million people [3].

**Question:**  How have preventive measures and latrine conditions improved in response to Cyclone Remal, and what is needed to ensure their long-term sustainability?
**Answer:** Preventive measures taken by households increased from a baseline of 49 to an endline of 59, and latrine conditions improved from a baseline of 22 to an endline of 48.8 [1]. These changes demonstrate a lasting shift in community practices and infrastructure [1]. However, the provided sources do not attribute these improvements to Cyclone Remal.

To ensure long-term sustainability, ongoing engagement, resource mobilization, and the integration of feedback mechanisms are required to adapt and respond to emerging needs and challenges [1].

**Question:**  What are the implications of the current gaps in early warning systems for cyclone preparedness in Bangladesh?
**Answer:** Current gaps in early warning systems have several implications for cyclone preparedness in regions like Bangladesh, which is among the poorest countries where these systems are often lacking [9].

Specifically for cyclones, accurate forecasts and useful early warnings require data from all countries in a particular region to be brought together and fed into weather models [1]. A significant data gap exists because weather data from exclusive economic zones is currently unavailable [1]. Furthermore, cyclones that form from the lower to middle troposphere are difficult to predict because they are not well organized and winds in the middle troposphere are not as strong [1].

These gaps mean that people cannot evacuate before a hazard hits, which prevents their exposure from being temporarily reduced [2][9]. Increasing the coverage of early warning systems would help to reduce this exposure [4]. The absence of such systems contributes to higher vulnerability in lower-income countries [8][11], where people are less protected [8][9] and populations cannot adequately prepare for storms [3].

**Question:**  What measures are being taken to address the impact of Cyclone Remal on the nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh?
**Answer:** To address the impact of Cyclone Remal, which poses a significant threat to the nearly 1 million Rohingya people in the world's largest refugee camp [2], the World Food Programme (WFP) provided 3,400 Rohingya refugees with fortified biscuits [2]. Additionally, ongoing needs assessments are being conducted to update and determine the extent of potential damage caused by the cyclone [2].

## SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation

**Question:**  What are the challenges faced by Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar regarding health and living conditions, as described in the text?
**Answer:** Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar face inhumane living conditions [1][5], with no investment in their living conditions or education [1]. The situation is dire [2], and conditions in the camps are deteriorating [2][3]. They are vulnerable to extreme weather events like cyclones and landslides [2], and climate-induced hazards such as floods and cyclones pose additional threats, leading to internal displacement [6]. There have also been fires in refugee camps [4], including an instance where an LPG gas canister exploded in a hut, setting it on fire [10].

Regarding health, there are a multitude of outbreaks in the camps [4], including diphtheria, cholera, measles, COVID-19, scabies, and dengue [4][7][11]. Skin diseases like dengue, eczema, and scabies are spreading rapidly due to waste around the camps [7].

**Question:**  How has the abandoned water treatment plant in Khulna affected the local community's access to clean water?
**Answer:** The water treatment plant on the outskirts of Khulna was designed to supply fresh water to 5,000 people [1]. It was once considered a "beacon of hope" [1] and "showed promise" [2] for the community. However, the project stalled in 2010 due to high costs and internal politics, and the site is now abandoned [1][7]. As a result, the plant is not supplying fresh water [1], contributing to a shortage of clean and safe water in Khulna [3]. Residents in areas like Notun Bazar regularly use saline water for cooking, drinking, and bathing [3], and there is no suitable water for them to drink and rehydrate [4]. This water crisis has become a major health hazard [4].

**Question:**  What are the health implications of using saline water for cooking, drinking, and bathing in Khulna, as highlighted by the case of Khatun's chronic kidney disease?

For Khulna, emergency medical teams have been formed and are ready to respond in all districts [1].

**Question:**  How is the Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) analyzing the projected impact of Cyclone Remal, and what are the key findings of their impact analysis?
**Answer:** The Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) has undertaken an impact analysis of the projected impact of Cyclone Remal [1]. NAWG functions as a platform for government and non-government humanitarian agencies under the Humanitarian Coordination Task Team (HCTT) [3][4], with its secretariat hosted by CARE Bangladesh under the "Supporting Bangladesh Rapid Needs Assessment SUBARNA III Project" [3]. NAWG does not generate or develop information; instead, it compiles and interpolates information from sources such as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) for its reports [10][12]. These reports are intended for internal use by NAWG Bangladesh Members for preparatory activities and are not official information of the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) [10][12].

Key findings from their impact analysis include:
*   Up to 1.9 million people are at risk [1].
*   An exposed population of 11 million people in areas with 110-120 km/hr wind speeds [2].
*   Projected maximum wind speeds are 55-56 km/h gusting to 65 km/h on May 25, 110-120 km/h gusting to 130 km/h on May 26, and 50-60 km/h gusting to 70 km/h on May 27 [4].

**Question:**  How have preventive measures and latrine conditions improved in response to Cyclone Remal, and what is needed to ensure their long-term sustainability?
**Answer:** Preventive measures taken by households increased from a baseline of 49 to an endline of 59, and latrine conditions improved from a baseline of 22 to an endline of 48.8 [1]. These changes demonstrate a lasting shift in community practices and infrastructure [1]. However, the provided sources do not attribute these improvements to Cyclone Remal.

To ensure long-term sustainability, ongoing engagement, resource mobilization, and the integration of feedback mechanisms are required to adapt and respond to emerging needs and challenges [1].

**Question:**  What measures are being taken to address the impact of Cyclone Remal on the nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh?
**Answer:** To address the impact of Cyclone Remal, which poses a significant threat to the nearly 1 million Rohingya people in the world's largest refugee camp [2], the World Food Programme (WFP) provided 3,400 Rohingya refugees with fortified biscuits [2]. Additionally, ongoing needs assessments are being conducted to update and determine the extent of potential damage caused by the cyclone [2].

## SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure

**Question:**  What are the implications of the current gaps in early warning systems for cyclone preparedness in Bangladesh?
**Answer:** Current gaps in early warning systems have several implications for cyclone preparedness in regions like Bangladesh, which is among the poorest countries where these systems are often lacking [9].

Specifically for cyclones, accurate forecasts and useful early warnings require data from all countries in a particular region to be brought together and fed into weather models [1]. A significant data gap exists because weather data from exclusive economic zones is currently unavailable [1]. Furthermore, cyclones that form from the lower to middle troposphere are difficult to predict because they are not well organized and winds in the middle troposphere are not as strong [1].

These gaps mean that people cannot evacuate before a hazard hits, which prevents their exposure from being temporarily reduced [2][9]. Increasing the coverage of early warning systems would help to reduce this exposure [4]. The absence of such systems contributes to higher vulnerability in lower-income countries [8][11], where people are less protected [8][9] and populations cannot adequately prepare for storms [3].

## SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities

**Question:**  What are the challenges faced by Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar regarding health and living conditions, as described in the text?
**Answer:** Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar face inhumane living conditions [1][5], with no investment in their living conditions or education [1]. The situation is dire [2], and conditions in the camps are deteriorating [2][3]. They are vulnerable to extreme weather events like cyclones and landslides [2], and climate-induced hazards such as floods and cyclones pose additional threats, leading to internal displacement [6]. There have also been fires in refugee camps [4], including an instance where an LPG gas canister exploded in a hut, setting it on fire [10].

Regarding health, there are a multitude of outbreaks in the camps [4], including diphtheria, cholera, measles, COVID-19, scabies, and dengue [4][7][11]. Skin diseases like dengue, eczema, and scabies are spreading rapidly due to waste around the camps [7].

**Question:**  What challenges are highlighted in the report regarding the global humanitarian funding crisis, and how do these challenges specifically impact the response to Cyclone Remal in Bangladesh?
**Answer:** The global humanitarian funding crisis is characterized by an elusive quick resolution [1] and a serious funding shortfall [3], leading to a "crisis within a crisis" [2][3]. This shortfall means that humanitarian organizations fell short of reaching their target in 2023, assisting less than two-thirds of the people they aimed to support [1]. Response plans for 2024 are ultra-prioritised with extremely tightened budgets [1].

The challenges include:
*   A widening gap between needs and response, exacerbated by conflicts, climate emergencies, and collapsing economies, which result in catastrophic hunger, massive displacement, and disease outbreaks [2].
*   The inability to deliver life-saving aid and essential services due to inadequate resources, which perpetuates cycles of suffering and worsens existing emergencies [4].
*   A reliance solely on humanitarian efforts that falls short in the long term [2].
*   The need for more flexible funding mechanisms, such as multi-year funding and reduced restrictions on fund allocation, to enhance the effectiveness of support [5].

The provided sources do not contain information on how these challenges specifically impact the response to Cyclone Remal in Bangladesh.

**Question:**  How is the Common Feedback Platform (CFP) contributing to the Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) in the Rohingya response in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh?
**Answer:** The Common Feedback Platform (CFP) aims to contribute towards Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) and inform programming within the Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh Rohingya response [1]. The CFP is a joint inter-agency report that provides an overview of community feedback raised in this response [1]. Through Complaints and Feedback Mechanisms (CFMs), affected communities share challenges regarding programs, services, and the associated humanitarian response [1]. Anonymized data from different organizations are combined and consolidated monthly to produce these reports [1].

## SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities

**Question:**  What measures has the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) taken in response to Cyclone Remal, and what are the expected impacts on the coastal districts?
**Answer:** The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) has taken several measures in response to Cyclone Remal. According to the BMD, a depression in the Bay of Bengal was likely to intensify into a severe cyclone named REMAL and make landfall between Kolkata, India, and Patuakhali, Bangladesh, from May 26 midnight to May 27 early morning 2024 [1][5]. The BMD issued Danger Signal 10 for the coastal districts of Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Pirojpur, Jhalokathi, Barguna, Barishal, Bhola, Patuakhali, and their offshore islands and chars [1][5]. Bangladesh Meteorological Department Director Azizur Rahman also reported that the severe Cyclone Remal had started crossing the Bangladesh coast and could continue hammering the coast until at least the early hours of Monday morning [4][6]. He stated that maximum wind speeds of 90 kilometers per hour had been recorded, with the possibility of picking up more pace [4][6].

The expected impacts on the coastal districts include maximum wind speeds hitting 100-110 km/h during high impact time [1][5], with some forecasts indicating winds reaching 110-120 kilometers per hour and gusts up to 135 kilometers per hour [2][7]. Heavy rainfall is forecast, with a possible risk of floods, flash floods, and landslides [1][5]. The cyclone could unleash a storm surge of up to 12 feet (four meters) above normal astronomical tide, which can be dangerous [4], or 8-12 feet above normal tide [12]. Most of Bangladesh's coastal areas are low-lying, making them vulnerable to devastation by high storm surges [4]. The low-lying areas of coastal districts such as Satkhira, Khulna, Bagerhat, Pirojpur, Jhalokathi, Barguna, Bhola, Patuakhali, Barishal, Noakhali, Lakshmipur, Feni, Cumilla, Chattogram, and Cox's Bazar, along with their offshore islands and chars, face a critical threat of inundation [12][13][14][16]. These areas are likely to be inundated by a wind-driven surge of 3-5 feet height of water above normal astronomical tide [13][16]. The storm is expected to bring heavy to very heavy rainfall and strong winds to these coastal areas [12][14].

**Question:**  How are local community-based groups and volunteers contributing to preparedness efforts for Cyclone Remal in Bangladesh?

## SDG 13 - Climate Action

**Question:**  What are the specific climate-related threats faced by Rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, as mentioned in the text?
**Answer:** Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, are vulnerable to extreme weather events [1] and face escalating climate-related threats [2]. Specific climate-induced hazards include cyclones [1][3], landslides [1], and floods [3].

**Question:**  What are the health implications of water salinity and extreme heat on the population in Khulna, as outlined in the text?
**Answer:** The population in Khulna faces health implications from water salinity and extreme heat.

**Water Salinity:**
The water crisis, which includes a lack of suitable drinking water for rehydration, has become a major health hazard with deadly consequences [1]. Saline intrusion results in a shortage of clean and safe water [3], leading residents to regularly use saline water for cooking, drinking, and bathing [3]. The increasing salinisation of freshwater resources in the region is putting the health of local populations under greater threat [4]. Research in coastal areas of south-western Bangladesh, including Khulna, investigated the effects of water salinity on kidney health [2]. This research found that drinking-water sodium and urinary sodium are associated with increased protein excretion, which is a powerful marker for kidney disease [5]. Among 1,185 trial participants, 37 had mild proteinuria and 20 had moderate or substantial proteinuria [2]. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been diagnosed in Khulna, with one individual's kidneys not working properly for nearly seven years, severely affecting her heart, lungs, and central nervous system [4][6]. An increase in kidney-related diseases is expected if water quality does not improve [8].

**Extreme Heat:**
Extreme heat in Khulna resulted in a rise in hospital admissions, forcing patients to occupy corridors and stairways as wards ran out of beds [1]. High temperatures cause profound sweating, loss of body fluid, and dehydration [1]. Research linked ambient temperature data to participants' health outcomes, comparing the effects of extreme heat on kidney health [5]. Findings suggest that women in tropical regions are as susceptible to the effects of high ambient temperature exposure as men [4].

**Question:** . What measures are being taken to ensure the safety of fishermen in the Bay of Bengal during Cyclone Remal?
**Answer:** To ensure the safety of fishermen during Cyclone Remal, there is a total suspension of fishing operations [1][7][10]. Fishermen are advised not to venture into the central Bay of Bengal until May 26th [2][4][8], and into the North Bay of Bengal until May 27th [2][4][8]. Additionally, fishermen are advised not to venture into the south Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea until May 27th, and into the North Bay of Bengal from May 25th till May 27th [4][8].

**Answer:** Families have been able to procure essential items such as food, medicines, and cattle feed with the cash assistance provided by WFP [2][3][4]. Additionally, some families have utilized the funds to reinforce their homes with ropes and arrange transportation for family members to safer locations [2][3][8].

**Question:**  How does WFP's Anticipatory Action programme aim to prevent and mitigate the effects of extreme weather on food security and nutrition in Bangladesh?
**Answer:** WFP's Anticipatory Action (AA) programme aims to prevent and mitigate, to the extent possible, the effects of extreme weather on the food security and nutrition of highly vulnerable people [2][7]. It enables the implementation and financing of actions before an extreme weather event occurs [2][7].

To achieve this, WFP provides forecast-based cash assistance [1], which aids families in preparing for and recovering from impending storms [3][5]. This assistance allows families to procure essential items such as food, medicines, and cattle feed [3][5][9], and to reinforce their homes with ropes or arrange transportation for family members to safer locations [3][9]. The cash distribution is complemented by early warning messages and evacuation support, coordinated with local government authorities [9].

In Bangladesh, WFP, along with national and local government partners, supports the development of early-warning systems and anticipatory actions for critical natural hazards including floods, cyclones, flash floods, and heavy rainfall [2]. As part of anticipatory action initiatives, WFP finalizes beneficiary databases for flood-prone areas in the northeast and cyclone-prone areas in the southwestern regions [6]. WFP also coordinates closely with partners to check beneficiary databases and prevent duplication of AA beneficiaries [8]. Furthermore, WFP participates in Disaster Management Committee (DMC) meetings to ensure a coordinated approach to preparedness and response [8], and its cooperating partners assist Cyclone Shelter Management Committees (SMCs) [8]. WFP camp retailer partners maintain emergency stocks of food for rapid response [8], and WFP works to mitigate transport and telecommunications disruptions [8].

**Question:**  What are the implications of the current gaps in early warning systems for cyclone preparedness in Bangladesh?
**Answer:** Current gaps in early warning systems have several implications for cyclone preparedness in regions like Bangladesh, which is among the poorest countries where these systems are often lacking [9].

Specifically for cyclones, accurate forecasts and useful early warnings require data from all countries in a particular region to be brought together and fed into weather models [1]. A significant data gap exists because weather data from exclusive economic zones is currently unavailable [1]. Furthermore, cyclones that form from the lower to middle troposphere are difficult to predict because they are not well organized and winds in the middle troposphere are not as strong [1].

These gaps mean that people cannot evacuate before a hazard hits, which prevents their exposure from being temporarily reduced [2][9]. Increasing the coverage of early warning systems would help to reduce this exposure [4]. The absence of such systems contributes to higher vulnerability in lower-income countries [8][11], where people are less protected [8][9] and populations cannot adequately prepare for storms [3].

**Question:**  What measures can be taken to reduce the vulnerability of low-income households in Bangladesh to cyclones and other climate-related disasters?
**Answer:** Measures that can be taken to reduce the vulnerability of low-income households to cyclones and other climate-related disasters include:
*   **Poverty Reduction** Lifting people out of poverty is an essential solution to reducing climate risks [4]. International cooperation and support are needed to ensure the poorest and most vulnerable are not left behind [12].
*   **Infrastructure and Housing Improvements** Investing in infrastructure is vital [3]. This includes people living in better buildings [9] and upholding strict building standards [12].
*   **Access to Basic Resources** Providing access to electricity and clean water [2], and air conditioning or heating to protect from extreme temperatures [2][9].
*   **Early Warning Systems** Increasing the coverage of early warning systems helps reduce exposure [7]. Better weather prediction and early warning systems allow people to evacuate before a hazard hits [8]. Accurate forecasts and useful early warnings require data from all countries in a region to be brought together and fed into weather models [14].
*   **Agricultural Productivity** Making agriculture more productive is vital [3], as more productive agricultural systems can recover from damaging events [8].
*   **Financial Resilience** Ensuring households have enough money to absorb shocks in energy or food prices and resources to recover after a disaster [2].
*   **Strong Governance and Support** Building strong political governance is vital [3]. Political systems should allow for national and international support before or after a hazard strikes [9]. Populations pushing for political rights and accountability also contribute [12].
*   **Human Capital Development** Disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies can impact human capital investment, including providing schooling opportunities for households constrained by subsistence consumption [1].

**Question:**  What are the challenges in predicting the formation and impact of cyclones like Cyclone Remal in Bangladesh due to the variability of winds in the troposphere?
**Answer:** It is difficult to predict cyclones when they form from the lower to middle troposphere because they are not well organized [1]. This lack of organization is due to winds in the middle troposphere not being as strong [1]. In contrast, winds in the upper troposphere are stronger and control the cyclone's structure, making it stable [1].

**Question:**  What measures are being taken to address the impact of Cyclone Remal on the nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh?
**Answer:** To address the impact of Cyclone Remal, which poses a significant threat to the nearly 1 million Rohingya people in the world's largest refugee camp [2], the World Food Programme (WFP) provided 3,400 Rohingya refugees with fortified biscuits [2]. Additionally, ongoing needs assessments are being conducted to update and determine the extent of potential damage caused by the cyclone [2].

## SDG 14 - Life Below Water

**Question:** . What measures are being taken to ensure the safety of fishermen in the Bay of Bengal during Cyclone Remal?
**Answer:** To ensure the safety of fishermen during Cyclone Remal, there is a total suspension of fishing operations [1][7][10]. Fishermen are advised not to venture into the central Bay of Bengal until May 26th [2][4][8], and into the North Bay of Bengal until May 27th [2][4][8]. Additionally, fishermen are advised not to venture into the south Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea until May 27th, and into the North Bay of Bengal from May 25th till May 27th [4][8].

**Question:**  What measures has the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) taken in response to Cyclone Remal, and what are the expected impacts on the coastal districts?
**Answer:** The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) has taken several measures in response to Cyclone Remal. According to the BMD, a depression in the Bay of Bengal was likely to intensify into a severe cyclone named REMAL and make landfall between Kolkata, India, and Patuakhali, Bangladesh, from May 26 midnight to May 27 early morning 2024 [1][5]. The BMD issued Danger Signal 10 for the coastal districts of Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Pirojpur, Jhalokathi, Barguna, Barishal, Bhola, Patuakhali, and their offshore islands and chars [1][5]. Bangladesh Meteorological Department Director Azizur Rahman also reported that the severe Cyclone Remal had started crossing the Bangladesh coast and could continue hammering the coast until at least the early hours of Monday morning [4][6]. He stated that maximum wind speeds of 90 kilometers per hour had been recorded, with the possibility of picking up more pace [4][6].

The expected impacts on the coastal districts include maximum wind speeds hitting 100-110 km/h during high impact time [1][5], with some forecasts indicating winds reaching 110-120 kilometers per hour and gusts up to 135 kilometers per hour [2][7]. Heavy rainfall is forecast, with a possible risk of floods, flash floods, and landslides [1][5]. The cyclone could unleash a storm surge of up to 12 feet (four meters) above normal astronomical tide, which can be dangerous [4], or 8-12 feet above normal tide [12]. Most of Bangladesh's coastal areas are low-lying, making them vulnerable to devastation by high storm surges [4]. The low-lying areas of coastal districts such as Satkhira, Khulna, Bagerhat, Pirojpur, Jhalokathi, Barguna, Bhola, Patuakhali, Barishal, Noakhali, Lakshmipur, Feni, Cumilla, Chattogram, and Cox's Bazar, along with their offshore islands and chars, face a critical threat of inundation [12][13][14][16]. These areas are likely to be inundated by a wind-driven surge of 3-5 feet height of water above normal astronomical tide [13][16]. The storm is expected to bring heavy to very heavy rainfall and strong winds to these coastal areas [12][14].

## SDG 15 - Life on Land

**Question:**  How is the Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) analyzing the projected impact of Cyclone Remal, and what are the key findings of their impact analysis?
**Answer:** The Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG) has undertaken an impact analysis of the projected impact of Cyclone Remal [1]. NAWG functions as a platform for government and non-government humanitarian agencies under the Humanitarian Coordination Task Team (HCTT) [3][4], with its secretariat hosted by CARE Bangladesh under the "Supporting Bangladesh Rapid Needs Assessment SUBARNA III Project" [3]. NAWG does not generate or develop information; instead, it compiles and interpolates information from sources such as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) for its reports [10][12]. These reports are intended for internal use by NAWG Bangladesh Members for preparatory activities and are not official information of the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) [10][12].

Key findings from their impact analysis include:
*   Up to 1.9 million people are at risk [1].
*   An exposed population of 11 million people in areas with 110-120 km/hr wind speeds [2].
*   Projected maximum wind speeds are 55-56 km/h gusting to 65 km/h on May 25, 110-120 km/h gusting to 130 km/h on May 26, and 50-60 km/h gusting to 70 km/h on May 27 [4].

## SDG 16 - Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions

**Question:**  What measures have been taken by the UN to address the allegations of human rights violations in Bangladesh, and how have these measures been communicated to the national authorities?
**Answer:** The UN Peacekeeping has continuously engaged bilaterally with national authorities to convey concerns about serious allegations of human rights violations by defense and security forces, particularly by members of Rab, in Bangladesh [1].

**Question:**  How did the coordination with the Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) and local government aid in the evacuation of at-risk communities in Bangladesh before Cyclone Remal?
**Answer:** Coordination with the Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) and local government was an action involved in evacuating at-risk communities in preparation for an impending cyclone [1].

**Question:**  What measures are being taken to address the impact of Cyclone Remal on the nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh?
**Answer:** To address the impact of Cyclone Remal, which poses a significant threat to the nearly 1 million Rohingya people in the world's largest refugee camp [2], the World Food Programme (WFP) provided 3,400 Rohingya refugees with fortified biscuits [2]. Additionally, ongoing needs assessments are being conducted to update and determine the extent of potential damage caused by the cyclone [2].

**Question:**  How is the Common Feedback Platform (CFP) contributing to the Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) in the Rohingya response in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh?
**Answer:** The Common Feedback Platform (CFP) aims to contribute towards Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) and inform programming within the Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh Rohingya response [1]. The CFP is a joint inter-agency report that provides an overview of community feedback raised in this response [1]. Through Complaints and Feedback Mechanisms (CFMs), affected communities share challenges regarding programs, services, and the associated humanitarian response [1]. Anonymized data from different organizations are combined and consolidated monthly to produce these reports [1].

## SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals

**Question:**  What contingency partnerships does UNICEF have in place for a rapid response to Cyclone Remal in Bangladesh, and how many can be reprogrammed for emergency response?
**Answer:** UNICEF has three contingency partnerships with civil society organizations (CSOs) that are ready for activation for a rapid response in cyclone-affected areas [1][3]. Additionally, 19 partnerships can be reprogrammed in case of emergency response [1][3].

**Question:**  What challenges are highlighted in the report regarding the global humanitarian funding crisis, and how do these challenges specifically impact the response to Cyclone Remal in Bangladesh?
**Answer:** The global humanitarian funding crisis is characterized by an elusive quick resolution [1] and a serious funding shortfall [3], leading to a "crisis within a crisis" [2][3]. This shortfall means that humanitarian organizations fell short of reaching their target in 2023, assisting less than two-thirds of the people they aimed to support [1]. Response plans for 2024 are ultra-prioritised with extremely tightened budgets [1].

The challenges include:
*   A widening gap between needs and response, exacerbated by conflicts, climate emergencies, and collapsing economies, which result in catastrophic hunger, massive displacement, and disease outbreaks [2].
*   The inability to deliver life-saving aid and essential services due to inadequate resources, which perpetuates cycles of suffering and worsens existing emergencies [4].
*   A reliance solely on humanitarian efforts that falls short in the long term [2].
*   The need for more flexible funding mechanisms, such as multi-year funding and reduced restrictions on fund allocation, to enhance the effectiveness of support [5].

The provided sources do not contain information on how these challenges specifically impact the response to Cyclone Remal in Bangladesh.
