# Israel-Hamas war-Week 19 2024 

## Summary 
Israeli military operations are escalating in Rafah, Gaza, with Israeli forces seizing the Rafah border crossing on Tuesday, which was a main entry point for aid, thereby dashing ceasefire hopes[27]. This seizure, along with the closure of the Kerem Shalom crossing, has halted the entry of fuel and aid into Gaza, creating a disastrous situation for humanitarian response and depleting critical supplies[30]. Israel has issued evacuation orders for parts of Rafah, causing chaos and panic among the population, with over 150,000 people having fled in recent days and around 300,000 affected by the orders[19]. Vulnerable individuals, including malnourished infants and injured patients, are among those forced to move to already overcrowded and unsafe areas like Al-Mawasi and Khan Younis, which lack adequate shelter and humanitarian supplies[19]. UN officials and humanitarian partners warn that these operations will lead to more death, displacement, and a humanitarian catastrophe, emphasizing that there are no safe spaces in Gaza[17]. Meanwhile, ceasefire talks are stalled, as Hamas accepted a proposal that Israel deemed unacceptable, particularly regarding a permanent end to hostilities[7], and violations against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have also substantially increased[12].

## Questions and Answers

### Humanitarian and Medical Aid Absence for Displaced in Northern Gaza Strip

**Question:**  What challenges are being faced in providing medical services and humanitarian aid to displaced people in the northern Gaza Strip?
**Answer:** There are no medical services or humanitarian aid being provided to the displaced people in the northern Gaza Strip[1].

### Escalating Conflict in Rafah: IDF Airstrikes and Mass Palestinian Evacuations

**Question:**  What specific actions have the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) taken in response to rocket and mortar fire from Rafah, and how have these actions impacted the humanitarian situation in the area?
**Answer:** The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have responded to rocket and mortar fire from Rafah by striking several sites in the area with aircraft[1]. These sites were used to fire rockets and mortars at Israel, including toward the Kerem Shalom Crossing[1]. Additionally, IDF troops engaged in close-quarters combat on the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing[1].

These Israeli operations and evacuation orders have significantly disrupted humanitarian activities in Gaza[2]. As a result of Israel's evacuation orders, Palestinians have evacuated Rafah[3], with roughly 50,000 people leaving the southern Gazan city in 48 hours[2][3][4], and over 150,000 people fleeing Rafah in recent days[2][3][4]. Around 300,000 people are now affected by these orders as Israel's attack on Rafah spreads and intensifies[2][3][4]. Displaced Palestinians have expressed fears following these orders[5], and many are sheltering in horrific conditions without adequate access to food, water, or other essentials[4]. The disruption to humanitarian operations in Rafah and the closure of Rafah Crossing will impact pre-existing needs in Rafah and across Gaza[2]. Extremely vulnerable people, including malnourished infants, the elderly, injured and sick patients, and people with severe disabilities, are among those ordered to move[4].

**Question:**  What measures are being taken to ensure the safety and well-being of displaced individuals, particularly those who are extremely vulnerable, in the areas to which they have been relocated?
**Answer:** The provided sources do not contain information detailing specific measures being taken to ensure the safety and well-being of displaced individuals, particularly vulnerable ones, in the areas to which they have been relocated. Instead, they indicate that humanitarian operations have been significantly disrupted[13], and many people are sheltering in horrific conditions without adequate access to food, water, or other essentials[12]. While Al-Mawasi is an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone[13], and some displaced Palestinians believe Al-Mawasi and Khan Younis are safe[11], the overall situation described points to a lack of such provisions[11].

### Israel's Control of Rafah Crossing Escalates Threat to Gaza Residents

**Question:**  What are the implications of Israel taking control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing for the humanitarian situation in Gaza?
**Answer:** Israel's control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing is considered a "dangerous escalation"[1]. This action threatens the lives of over a million Palestinians who rely on this crossing as the primary lifeline of the Gaza Strip[1].

### Infrastructure Deficiencies and Humanitarian Concerns Amid Rafah Evacuation Orders

**Question:**  What infrastructure challenges are present in the designated humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi for displaced Gazans, and how might these affect the provision of aid?
**Answer:** The designated humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi "certainly does not have the infrastructure that you would expect"[1]. It is "essentially a sandy area"[1], lacking "sewage infrastructure," "water infrastructure," and "roads that lead into it"[1]. The provided sources do not explicitly state how these infrastructure challenges might affect the provision of aid.

**Question:**  How does the UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk view the Israeli orders for Palestinians to evacuate parts of Rafah, and what are the anticipated humanitarian consequences?
**Answer:** The UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk warned that Israel's orders for Palestinians to evacuate parts of Rafah, ahead of an anticipated new offensive, would cause civilian deaths, suffering, and destruction to increase beyond already unbearable levels[11]. He stated that Gazans are already being affected by bombs, disease, and famine, and are now being told to relocate again as Israeli military operations in Rafah escalate[11]. Türk views these orders as contrary to the basic principles of international humanitarian and human rights laws, which prioritize the effective protection of civilians[11].

He also stated that Palestinians remaining in Rafah would continue to be at risk of death and injury from indiscriminate bombing, unlawful killing, or loss of access to food, water, and healthcare[13]. Türk emphasized that this situation "must not be allowed to happen" and that those who choose to disregard international humanitarian law and international human rights law must be held accountable[13].

### Gaza Humanitarian Crisis Worsens: Aid Blocked, Fuel and Supplies Depleted

**Question:**  What are the consequences of the ongoing military operations and lack of aid entering Gaza, as reported by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA)?
**Answer:** According to Scott Anderson from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), no aid is being received, and the crossing area has ongoing military operations and is an active war zone[1]. He stated that no fuel or aid has entered the Gaza Strip, which is "disastrous for the humanitarian response"[5]. UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini also indicated that UNRWA needs to "reconstitute our stock to be able to resume distribution in the south of the Gaza Strip"[6].

**Question:**  How is the lack of fuel impacting humanitarian operations and daily life in Gaza, according to UN officials?
**Answer:** According to UN officials, the lack of fuel is critically impacting humanitarian operations and daily life in Gaza[11].

For humanitarian operations, fuel is considered critical and could run out "tomorrow"[11]. Andrea de Domenico, head of the UN humanitarian affairs office (OCHA), stated that humanitarians have approximately 30,000 litres of diesel available, while they normally use 200,000 litres daily[13][14][16][19]. The closure of the Rafah crossing with Egypt has cut off access to fuel, which affects the entry of critical relief items and restricts the movement of aid workers[11]. Scott Anderson from UNRWA noted that no fuel has entered the Gaza Strip, which is "disastrous for the humanitarian response"[15]. Aid agencies are nearly out of fuel[15], and stocks of critical supplies, including fuel, are being depleted hourly[20]. Priority for the remaining fuel is given to health, water, and communication, with some reserved for the secure movement of staff[13][14]. The UN aid coordination office (OCHA) is engaging with parties to resume the entry of goods, including fuel[20].

Regarding daily life, UN humanitarians have reported concerns over dwindling supplies of fuel and other basic necessities in Gaza[12]. The prioritization of fuel for health, water, and communication services indicates the impact on these essential aspects of daily life[13].

**Question:**  How has the acceptance of a ceasefire proposal by Hamas and the subsequent Israeli response affected the humanitarian conditions in Rafah?
**Answer:** Hamas accepted a ceasefire proposal from Egypt and Qatar[21]. In response, Israel stated it would send a delegation to negotiate, but warned the proposal was far from "necessary requirements"[21]. The Israeli military also called on Palestinians in parts of eastern Rafah to "evacuate immediately"[21].

This sequence of events, including the "dashing ceasefire hopes"[22], was followed by the seizure of the Rafah crossing by Israeli forces on Tuesday[21]. Rafah is the main entry point for aid into Gaza[29]. As a result, no aid or fuel has entered the Gaza Strip[22], and aid agencies are nearly out of food and fuel[29]. Fuel critical for humanitarian operations could run out "tomorrow," and some food stocks might only last until the end of the week[25]. The closure of the Rafah crossing has severed access to fuel, affecting critical relief items and curtailing the movement of aid workers[25].

Furthermore, Israeli evacuation orders[27]and attacks on Rafah[23]have forced tens of thousands[22]and over 100,000 people to flee[26][28]. These displaced individuals have nowhere safe to go[29], as designated evacuation sites like Al-Mawasi are overstretched, lack vital services, and are not safe[29]. People in these areas face impending famine, lack of shelter, spread of disease, and scarce healthcare availability[29]. Israeli ground operations and attacks in Rafah are escalating[28], bringing more death and displacement[21].

**Question:** . How are the ongoing hostilities and military operations in Rafah affecting the ability of humanitarian agencies to deliver aid?
**Answer:** The ongoing military operations and hostilities in Rafah are severely impacting humanitarian aid delivery[38]. No aid has been received, and the crossing area is an active war zone with continued bombardments[31]. The Rafah crossing, which serves as the main entry point for aid into Gaza and a lifeline for its people, was seized by Israeli forces on Tuesday[34]. Since last Sunday, no aid has entered Gaza by land[38]. This closure has severed access to fuel, affecting the entry of critical relief items and curtailing the movement of aid workers[36]. Aid agencies are almost out of food and fuel in Gaza[38]. Fuel critical for humanitarian operations could run out soon, and some food stocks might only last to the end of the week[36]. Stocks of critical supplies, including fuel, are being depleted by the hour[33]. Israeli attacks on Rafah threaten the delivery of new aid supplies[32]. Additionally, more than a quarter of humanitarian missions to northern Gaza in April were impeded by Israeli authorities, and 10 percent were denied[34][40]. The situation remains extremely fluid amid active hostilities[31].

**Question:**  What challenges are being faced by the humanitarian teams in Rafah, given the presence of over 1 million people, including 600,000 children?
**Answer:** Humanitarian teams in Rafah, where well over 1 million people including 600,000 children remain, face significant challenges[41][42][43][46]. No aid, fuel, or critical relief items are entering Gaza, as the crossing area is an active war zone with ongoing military operations and bombardments[44]. The closure of the Rafah crossing has severed access to fuel and curtailed the movement of aid workers[47]. Fuel critical for humanitarian operations could run out, and some food stocks might only last to the end of the week[47]. Aid agencies are almost out of food and fuel, with stocks of critical supplies being depleted by the hour[47]. The situation remains extremely fluid amid active hostilities[42]. There are no safe zones in Gaza[42], and designated evacuation sites like Al Mawasi are unsuitable for hosting large numbers of displaced people, being overstretched and devoid of vital services, lacking capacity, safety assurances, and proper accommodation[47]. The safety of humanitarian workers is also a concern[49]. The lack of fuel has caused bakeries to stop working, leading to no bread, and has also affected water supply[45].

### Fuel Shortage and Blocked Aid Worsen Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza Conflict

**Question:**  How has the conflict in Gaza affected the ability of humanitarian teams to operate and provide aid in Rafah?
**Answer:** The conflict in Gaza has severely affected the ability of humanitarian teams to operate and provide aid in Rafah. There is a dire shortage of fuel, which hinders everything from the movement and distribution of food to the operation of hospitals, emergency services, sewage treatment, and telecommunications[5]. Fuel critical for humanitarian operations could run out[6].

Aid flow through the Rafah crossing has halted, with no aid trucks entering since May 5[7]. The Rafah and Karem Abu Salem crossings, which were key entry points for limited aid, have been disrupted[8]. Israeli forces seized the Rafah crossing[7]and blocked the passage for people and humanitarian aid[7]. No fuel or aid has entered the Gaza Strip, which is disastrous for the humanitarian response[7]. The closure of the Rafah crossing has also severed access to fuel, affecting the entry of critical relief items and curtailing the movement of aid workers[6].

Furthermore, there are no safe places in Gaza[7], as Israel has repeatedly attacked so-called 'safe zones'[7]. Other towns, like Khan Younis, have been reduced to rubble and remain under attack, making them unsafe[5]. Evacuation orders have uprooted tens of thousands of people in Rafah, sowing fear and confusion among civilians[8]. The meagre humanitarian aid reaching people will be severely disrupted[4], and the closure of crossings will lead to increased hunger and scarcity[6].

**Question:** . What are the main obstacles to achieving a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, according to the provided text?
**Answer:** The main obstacles to achieving a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas include Israel's rejection of proposals that do not meet its "core demands"[11]and its stated "red line" against a permanent end to hostilities[14]. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will not accept an end to the war[14]and that Israel has "no choice" but to destroy Hamas[13], which is his goal[14]. For Hamas, releasing hostages without an assurance of a permanent ceasefire is not acceptable[14].

Hamas stated that Israel's rejection of the mediators' proposal returned things to "the first square"[11], and a senior Hamas official said "occupation Israelis turned against the mediators' proposal"[18]. Hamas had agreed to a framework proposal that diverged from the one Israel had helped craft[12].

Additionally, Israel's renewed military activity in Rafah[11], its plan for an all-out assault on Rafah[11], and the seizure of the Rafah crossing by Israeli forces have dashed ceasefire hopes[19]. The UN Secretary-General has called on both Hamas and Israel "to show political courage" to secure a ceasefire[15].
