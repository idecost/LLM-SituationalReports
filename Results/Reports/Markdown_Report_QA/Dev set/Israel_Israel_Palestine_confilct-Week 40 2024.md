# Israel Palestine

## Summary 
The situation in Gaza is dire, marked by ongoing Israeli military operations, including renewed ground invasions and persistent airstrikes that have repeatedly targeted schools and other shelters for internally displaced persons, causing numerous fatalities, including children and women[98]. Over the past year, the conflict has resulted in more than 41,500 to 50,000 Palestinian deaths and approximately 100,000 injuries in Gaza, with thousands still missing, while 101 hostages remain captive[81]. Nearly 1.9 million people are displaced, facing a severe humanitarian crisis with widespread acute malnutrition among children, intentional blocking of food and medicine, and a devastated healthcare system where only half of hospitals are partially operational and mental health needs have tripled[50]. Infrastructure is extensively damaged, including over 68% of cropland and roads, and a significant number of housing units, contributing to an environmental catastrophe with contaminated water and the re-emergence of polio[6]. The West Bank also experiences escalating violence and damage[73], prompting international calls for an immediate ceasefire, full humanitarian access, and accountability for international law violations[55].

## Questions and Answers

### Urgent Measures Needed to Protect Civilians and Ensure Aid Delivery in Gaza

**Question:**  What are the logistical challenges faced by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in delivering agricultural aid to Gaza, and how are they being addressed?
**Answer:** The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has experienced logistical challenges, particularly due to restrictions at crossings and the collapse of law and order, which constrains the delivery of agricultural aid into Gaza[11]. FAO is ready to deliver more inputs to Gazan farmers and herders once access, security, and mobility conditions are fully restored[19]. The provided sources do not detail how these challenges are currently being addressed by FAO.

### Severe Humanitarian Crisis for Gaza IDPs Amidst Shelter and Supply Shortages

**Question:**  How are displacement and the lack of basic necessities affecting the living conditions of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Gaza?
**Answer:** Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Gaza are living in dire conditions[2]. Sites visited by UNRWA protection monitors are characterized by worn out tents and tarpaulins, a lack of mattresses, key non-food items (NFIs), and insufficient food, water, and sanitation[1][2]. The approaching adverse weather conditions are a key concern[2].

The lack of basic necessities significantly affects IDPs:
*   There is a continued spread of skin diseases and an acute lack of medications[6].
*   IDPs are deeply distressed about the lack of assistance[2].
*   The limited availability of supplies, including sanitary pads, dignity, and menstrual hygiene management (MHM) kits, disproportionately affects women and girls, increasing their vulnerability to disease and risk of gender-based violence (GBV)[2]. An estimated over 800,000 dignity kits are currently required, far exceeding the 1,900 distributed by partners[10].
*   Shortages of blankets, shoes, warm clothes, and other winter items are expected to exacerbate suffering[9].
*   The shortage of tents impacts the ability to expand group-based psychosocial support and provide safe spaces or temporary accommodation for unaccompanied children[1][2].
*   Cash shortages negatively affect living conditions and increase the risk of exposure to violence or exploitation for women and girls[5].

**Question:**  What are the specific challenges faced by internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Gaza regarding shelter, food, and sanitation, and how are these challenges being addressed?
**Answer:** Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Gaza face several challenges regarding shelter, food, and sanitation.

**Challenges:**
*   **Shelter:** IDP sites are in dire condition[12], characterized by worn-out tents and tarpaulins, a lack of mattresses, key non-food items (NFIs), and insufficient food, water, and sanitation[12]. There is a shortage of tents, which affects the ability to expand group-based psycho-social support and provide safe spaces or temporary accommodation for unaccompanied children[12][13]. In September, only nine trucks of shelter items were received via the Fence Road[14]. The capacity to conduct repairs or provide alternative places for families is limited, preventing practical support for those in damaged buildings beyond awareness-raising[12].
*   **Food and Water:** There is insufficient food, water, and sanitation[12]. A major problem is the shortage of food and water[12]. Food prices are exorbitantly high, with vegetables being 10 times more expensive than before the war, and a kilo of tomatoes reaching nearly 10 (or 8)[14].
*   **Sanitation:** There is insufficient food, water, and sanitation[12].
*   **General Conditions:** IDP sites are in dire condition, with a continued spread of skin diseases and an acute lack of medications[11]. IDPs are deeply distressed about the lack of assistance[12]. The limited availability of supplies on the local market, including menstrual hygiene management (MHM) and dignity kits, has disproportionately affected women and girls, increasing their vulnerability to disease[12][13]. Cash shortages hinder the use of Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA), negatively affecting living conditions, increasing the risk of exposure to violence or exploitation for women and girls, and undermining partners' ability to pay local service providers and staff salaries[17][18].

**Addressing Challenges:**
*   UNRWA's protection teams identify and respond to protection risks and needs of displaced people in Khan Younis and Deir al Balah, including Al Mawasi[15].
*   Protection Monitors visit shelters and IDP sites, providing awareness sessions, undertaking focus group discussions and key informant interviews, monitoring aid distribution, and following up on vulnerable cases[11]. They also monitor learning activities in shelters to prioritize children's safety, dignity, and wellbeing[11].
*   Site Management Working Group (SMWG) partners monitored 38 sites hosting approximately 170,875 people[11].
*   Emergency Preparedness and Response (EPRs) and Protection Cluster staff support inter-cluster assessments, conduct key informant interviews, facilitate focus group discussions, and refer protection cases[11].
*   Child Protection partners began data collection to plan for winterization activities, including procuring psychosocial support kits and winter clothes through the private sector[16].
*   12 Gender-Based Violence (GBV) partners distributed 1,900 dignity kits in Deir al Balah and Khan Younis, though this is far below the estimated need of over 800,000 kits[15].
*   The GBV sub-cluster is assessing the potential for cash assistance to address urgent needs of women and girls[14].
*   Efforts are ongoing to strengthen Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) services for women and girls at risk of GBV[14].
*   Partners are working with the Shelter Cluster to develop a referral protocol to mitigate the risk of exploitation of vulnerable cases[14].
*   The cluster alerts families in damaged buildings of risks through awareness-raising messages[16].

**Question:**  How are food shortages and high prices affecting the daily lives of residents, and what coping mechanisms are being employed?
**Answer:** Food shortages and exorbitantly high prices significantly affect daily life[21]. There is a major shortage of food and water[24], with the price of food being exorbitantly high[24]. Vegetables are 10 times more expensive than before the war, and a kilo of tomatoes has reached nearly 8-10[24]. People are deeply distressed about the lack of assistance[23].

Coping mechanisms include living mostly on canned food and cooking on a fire, although finding firewood can be impossible[27]. Individuals may accept free food when unable to afford items due to high prices[21]. Families also cope by selflessly sharing their limited food, even if it means going without[21]. However, cash shortages hinder the use of Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) by some recipients, negatively affecting living conditions[26].

### Forced Displacement and Airstrikes Severely Impact Aid Distribution in Gaza

**Question:**  How has forced population movement disrupted the operations and distribution capacity of humanitarian partners in Gaza?
**Answer:** Forced population movement has disrupted the capacity of partners to maintain operations and distribute to those in need in Gaza[1]. As a result, the World Food Programme (WFP) will no longer distribute food baskets through its general food distributions across Gaza in October, due to critically restricted flow of essential goods[1].

**Question:**  What are the reported consequences of Israeli airstrikes on UN-run schools in Gaza, and how has this affected the displaced Palestinian population?
**Answer:** Israeli airstrikes have recently hit at least six UN-run schools sheltering displaced Palestinians[11]. The UN is "very concerned about the toll of repeated airstrikes on shelters for displaced people on the Strip"[11]. These attacks on buildings acting as shelters for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) have become an almost daily event[14]. In the last 72 hours alone, at least six schools serving as IDP shelters were struck, resulting in tens of fatalities, including children and women[14][17].

Specifically, two separate Israeli airstrikes early Sunday morning targeted a mosque and the Ibn Rushd School in Al-Zawaida, both sheltering displaced civilians in central Gaza[12][13]. These attacks killed at least 24 Palestinians, including children, and injured 93 others[12], with another report stating 26 Palestinians, including children, were killed and 93 injured[12]. The effect on the displaced Palestinian population is that families are ordered from one area to another and then bombed in the schools and tents where they are told to shelter[15].

### Urgent Humanitarian Response Needed for Health Crisis in Gaza Amid Infrastructure Collapse

**Question:**  What are the primary drivers of diseases in Gaza as mentioned in the report?
**Answer:** The primary drivers of diseases in Gaza are the poor water, sanitation, and hygiene situation, along with overcrowding in shelters[6]. These conditions are expected to worsen during winter[6]. The lack of clean water and hygiene products is causing outbreaks of diarrhoea and skin diseases[1]. The breakdown of sanitation infrastructure has resulted in a proliferation of disease vectors[2], and the collapse of waste management systems, including hazardous medical waste, contributes to contamination[5]. Accumulated waste also attracts vermin and insects, spreading pathogens[10]. The inability to maintain a minimal level of hygiene severely impacts health[7], and without access to soap, water, or toilets in crowded conditions, the risk of epidemics is skyrocketing[5].

**Question:**  How have Israeli air strikes affected the safety and living conditions in Gaza?
**Answer:** Israeli air strikes have impacted safety and living conditions in Gaza. Areas have not been spared from Israeli air strikes, proving zones are far from safe[11]. Constant Israeli attacks have damaged over 370,000 housing units, completely destroying 79,000 homes[12]. Approximately 68% of cropland and roads have also been severely damaged[12]. These strikes have led to overcrowding and appalling sanitary conditions[17]. Food is scarce, and the lack of clean water and hygiene products is causing outbreaks of diarrhoea and skin diseases[11]. As of September 2024, only 17 of 36 hospitals remain partially functional, suffering from a lack of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water due to constant Israeli attacks[12].

### Impact of Gaza Conflict on Maternity Care and Civilian Well-being

**Question:**  How has the conflict affected the availability and quality of maternity care in Gaza, as described in Ala'a's story?
**Answer:** The conflict has severely impacted maternity care in Gaza, contributing to a reported rise in miscarriages, obstetric complications, low birth weight, and premature births, primarily due to stress, malnutrition, and a near-total lack of maternity care[1].

In Ala'a's experience, she was forced to leave her home and live in a tent at seven months pregnant[10]. She desired to give birth at home but had to deliver her baby outside of her home[10], after experiencing early labor and four days of labor[1]. She was informed that a natural birth was too dangerous[7]. Ala'a delivered her baby, Mohammad, in a field hospital in Khan Younis[10], which featured a specialized maternity unit supported by UK-Med and the UN agency for sexual and reproductive health, UNFPA[7].

Despite the ongoing war and a lack of clean water, food, or security, Ala'a and her newborn Mohammad recovered well[7]. Ala'a described the health staff as tireless[10]and a "great team"[1], noting they smiled even under pressure[7]. She considered it the "best decision" to give birth there[7]and expressed gratitude to the hospital staff[8]. However, it is stated that continuous support for health services is impossible without a ceasefire, full access, and sustained funding[8]. Ala'a also endured multiple evacuations and fled under fire[1].

**Question:**  How has the conflict impacted the lives of individuals like Taleen Al-Hinnawi and Nada Al-Gharib, and what challenges do they face in orphanage camps?
**Answer:** The conflict has profoundly impacted individuals like Taleen Al-Hinnawi and Nada Al-Gharib. Taleen Al-Hinnawi lost her father due to the war and is adjusting to her new life in the Al-Baraka orphanage camp[11]. She shows signs of shock and sadness[11], and described her father as "very affectionate," stating, "I don't feel like Baba was martyred"[11]. She and her mother found a "second home" in the Al-Baraka orphanage camp after fleeing Rafah and passing through Israeli checkpoints[11]. In the camp, everyone shares similar stories and pain, fostering a sense of community where they are "like siblings" and "all mothers are like our mothers"[11].

Nada Al-Gharib lost her father and her only brother due to the war[12]. She and her mother were injured in a strike on their tent in Khan Younis, where they were trapped for three days[13]. Her family had been displaced from northern Gaza to Khan Younis because "the occupation demanded of us"[13]. After leaving the tent, Nada and her mother went to the industrial area west of Khan Younis for treatment and were trapped again[13]. Nada described her father as a great, kind man who loved his family[18]. Despite the hardships and loss, she stated, "We love our lives. Even though it's hard and the loss of our loved ones is hard for us, we try to live for them"[18].

Regarding challenges in orphanage camps, Taleen Al-Hinnawi faces the challenge of adjusting to her new life in the Al-Baraka orphanage camp[11]. While the camp provides a supportive environment where residents share experiences and feel like family[11], the provided sources do not detail specific operational challenges within the orphanage camps themselves.

**Question:** . How did UK-Med and UNFPA support Ala'a and other pregnant women in Gaza during the conflict?
**Answer:** UK-Med runs a field hospital in Khan Younis that includes a specialized maternity unit[21]. This maternity unit is supported by UK-Med, the United Kingdom, and UNFPA[21]. UNFPA provides the hospital's maternity unit with reproductive health kits and supplies[22]and ensures staff can offer comprehensive care, including for obstetric emergencies[22]. Ala'a visited this field hospital for a check-up[21]and later delivered her baby there[22], stating it was the best decision to come there to give birth[22]and expressing gratitude to the staff[27].

### Emergency Response Challenges Amid Israeli Blockade and Strikes in Gaza Strip

**Question:**  What challenges are first responders facing in reaching affected areas in northern Gaza, as reported by the Civil Defense?
**Answer:** The Civil Defense first responders, who operate under the Hamas-run government, reported that they were not able to reach several hit homes and buildings because of the bombardment[11].

**Question:**  What are the reported consequences of the Israeli military's Operation Iron Swords on the civilian population in Gaza?
**Answer:** The Israeli military's Operation Iron Swords included a complete blockade of the Gaza Strip[21]. Reported consequences for the civilian population in Gaza include a death toll exceeding 41,800 since October 7, according to the enclave's health ministry[21], with other reports stating over 41,500 killed and almost 100,000 wounded from nearly a year of relentless Israeli attacks[22], and the death toll nearing 42,000 according to the Palestinian Health Ministry[21]. Thousands are also reported missing under the rubble of destroyed buildings[26].

Heavy Israeli strikes have been reported across northern Gaza[26], with dozens of explosions from air strikes and tank shelling shaking the ground and buildings[23]. Several homes and buildings have been hit, and first responders were unable to reach them due to bombardment[26]. Strikes have also been reported in Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, with roads closed[28]. The Jabalia refugee camp has been surrounded[28].

The Israeli army has dropped leaflets ordering people to flee their homes[23]and issued evacuation orders[21], leading people to leave their homes without knowing where to go or having means of transportation[21]. Strikes have targeted shelters, including a mosque and a school, killing people who were sheltering there[21]. Children are suffering, and hunger is spreading and deepening due to almost no basic supplies being available[28]. Residents are ordered to move to the humanitarian zone in southern Gaza[21], but some are unwilling due to perceived dangers and reports of the army shooting at people there[21].

### UN Urges Israel to Investigate Human Rights Violations Transparently and Independently

**Question:**  How does the UN Human Rights office suggest Israel should address the accountability of perpetrators of human rights violations?
**Answer:** The UN Human Rights office suggests that Israel must carry out a thorough, prompt, independent, and transparent investigation into incidents and hold perpetrators of violations to account, as required by international human rights law[1][2][3].

### UN Urges Palestinian Armed Groups to Cease Using Civilians as Shields

**Question:**  What role does the UN Human Rights Office play in addressing the use of civilians as shields by Palestinian armed groups?
**Answer:** The UN Human Rights Office reminds Palestinian armed group members that using the presence of civilians to shield themselves from attack constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law (IHL)[1]. They also state that Palestinian armed groups must cease and refrain from any such use and take all feasible precautions to protect civilians under their control from the effects of hostilities[1].

### Comprehensive Humanitarian Response Amidst Severe Infrastructure Damage in Gaza Conflict

**Question:**  What measures have been taken to provide food and water to displaced people in Gaza shelters?
**Answer:** Measures taken to provide food and water to displaced people in Gaza shelters include feeding displaced people in shelters with hot meals, food packs, vegetables, and vouchers[1]. Clean water and nutritional supplements have also been distributed to people in shelters[1]. Additionally, over 40 million hot meals have been cooked and distributed for displaced families[2], and water has been provided to 110,000 people daily[1]. Nutritional supplements are supplied to 35,000 pregnant women and young children every two weeks[2]. A Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition program was launched, and 1,700 cartons of Ready to Use Therapeutic Food were delivered to northern Gaza[6]. MSF teams have also offered water distribution[1].

**Question:**  What are the mental health challenges faced by the population in Gaza, and how are humanitarian organizations addressing these issues?
**Answer:** The conflict has raised deep concerns about mental health in Gaza[16]. Before the war, over 485,000 people had already been diagnosed with mental disorders[12]. Teams have cared for patients with mental health conditions[16]. Humanitarian organizations are addressing these issues by running psychosocial support sessions for over 94,000 children[17]and offering mental health services[12].

**Question:**  What impact has the destruction of homes and infrastructure had on the daily lives of Gaza residents, as described by individuals like Islamic Relief staff?
**Answer:** The destruction of homes and infrastructure has profoundly impacted the daily lives of Gaza residents[21]. An Islamic Relief staff member reported that their own house is damaged and uninhabitable, and their siblings and all colleagues have lost their homes[21]. This staff member also stated that their Islamic Relief office is gone, along with children's schools, a mosque, a hospital, restaurants, and a church, concluding that their lives are being systematically destroyed[21]. The level of destruction is so severe that people cannot return to their homes, even if the conflict were to cease[21].

Civilian infrastructure, including schools, religious buildings, hospitals, and bakeries, has been destroyed[22]. The healthcare system has been systematically dismantled[23], with most primary healthcare centers out of action[26]and critical services like oncology, MRI, specialized pediatric surgery, and endocrinology out of commission[24]. There is no electricity in Gaza, except for generators whose operation is hindered by the high price of fuel[28]. This has led to a significant drop in access to services such as water, food, and education, which is described as a "real shock"[28]. There is also a rise in infectious diseases like gastroenteritis, spread through polluted water, as well as skin infections and hepatitis A[26].

### WHO Urges Ceasefire and Protection of Healthcare in Conflict Zones

**Question:**  What actions have been taken by the World Health Organization (WHO) in response to the conflict, and what are their calls for de-escalation and protection of healthcare?
**Answer:** The World Health Organization (WHO) calls for a de-escalation of the conflict[1]. They also advocate for healthcare to be protected and not attacked[1], for access routes to be secured[1], and for supplies to be delivered[1]. Furthermore, WHO calls for a ceasefire, a political solution, and peace[1], with Tedros stating that "The best medicine is peace"[1].

### Escalating Humanitarian Crisis in Israel-Gaza: Urgent Need for Ceasefire and Aid

**Question:**  How has the conflict impacted the mental health care needs in Israel, and what resources are available to address the increased demand?
**Answer:** The conflict has led to a collective trauma in Israel that has spread at pandemic speed, doubling and in some parts tripling the demand for mental health care[2]. The provided sources do not contain information on specific resources available in Israel to address this increased demand.

**Question:**  How has the international community responded to calls for a ceasefire and accountability for violations of international humanitarian law in the Israel and Palestine conflict?
**Answer:** The international community's response to calls for a ceasefire has been mixed, with a sustained ceasefire not yet achieved[19]. Organizations continue to call for an immediate and lasting ceasefire[13]. However, Israel, Hamas, and their respective allies have "catastrophically failed" to reach a deal on a sustained ceasefire[18]. Israel's allies have continued to provide military support to Israel[17], even while publicly speaking on the importance of a ceasefire[17]. The United States, while recently espousing calls for a ceasefire, has frequently worked to "obfuscate, block, and undermine ceasefire efforts" through its role in the United Nations Security Council, vetoing previous resolutions and continuing to provide arms to Israel[19]. As a result, there is "still no ceasefire in sight"[12].

Regarding accountability for violations of international humanitarian law, there are calls for perpetrators to be held accountable for any serious violations[14]. However, the past 12 months have been marked by "shameful inaction"[20], and concerns are raised that Israel has a "free pass for impunity and exemption from international humanitarian law"[15]and blocks aid "with impunity as the world watches"[12]. International governments are urged to use their leverage to demand an end to attacks on civilians and violations of international law, including by ending all arms sales that fuel the violence[12]. The international community is also called upon to act swiftly and forcefully to end Israel's "crime of genocide"[11]. The US has a responsibility to ensure its support is not used to harm civilians[19].

**Question:**  What are the reported impacts of the Israeli military operations on the civilian population in Gaza, including fatalities, injuries, and displacement?
**Answer:** Israeli military operations in Gaza have resulted in significant impacts on the civilian population, including fatalities, injuries, and displacement.

More than 41,500 people have been killed[21], with children killed en masse[26]. Specifically, 118 children and young people who were cared for have been killed since the crisis began[21]. There have also been 765 deaths resulting from at least 516 attacks on healthcare in Gaza since October 2023[21]. The international community is called upon to end Israel's crime of genocide, which involves the direct killing of Palestinian people[22], and to stop the indiscriminate killing of civilians[21].

Over 96,000 people have been wounded[21]. Medical staff have treated patients daily for wounds caused by massive bombings[30], including extensive burns, crushed bones, and dismembered or amputated limbs[30]. Palestinians in Gaza are suffering from war wounds, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and mental trauma[30]. At least 12,000 people are in desperate need of medical evacuation[25].

The civilian population has been repeatedly displaced and forced into smaller and smaller areas under bombardments[23]. There has been forced displacement of civilians[21], and almost everyone is displaced[23]. People are living in overcrowded and inhumane conditions[30].

**Question:**  What are the reported figures of fatalities and injuries among Israeli soldiers since the start of the ground operation in the Gaza Strip?
**Answer:** As of September 25, there have been 346 reported fatalities and 2,290 reported injuries of Israeli soldiers since the start of the ground operation in the Gaza Strip[31].

### Escalating Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza and West Bank: Urgent Action Required

**Question:**  What are the specific impacts of military operations on civilian infrastructure in the West Bank, and how are they affecting daily life?
**Answer:** Military operations in the West Bank cause significant damage to civilian infrastructure[1], including the forced demolition of over 2,000 Palestinian homes and massive damage to public infrastructure, such as roads[1]. This has led to widespread destruction[1]. These operations, along with increased violence, movement restrictions, and economic disruption, severely impact daily life[1]. They also contribute to extreme mental distress and increased mental health concerns among the West Bank population[2], and have resulted in forced displacement[2].

**Question:**  What are the specific challenges faced by women and children in Gaza as a result of the conflict, and how are these challenges being addressed by humanitarian organizations?
**Answer:** Women in Gaza face a double burden, suddenly becoming heads of their households and navigating survival and care amidst destruction[11]. Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers have experienced immense difficulties due to the collapse in healthcare services[11]. Women also have to fetch water and perform tasks traditionally done by men because they have lost male family members[14].

Children in Gaza are experiencing profound trauma[14], grappling with anxiety and severe physical injuries, with many having lost limbs[16]. They have missed an entire year of education[14], and schools sheltering displaced families have been repeatedly shelled[13]. Over five times more children were killed in Gaza in the last year than between 2005 and 2022 combined[19]. UNICEF states that children are dying at an alarming rate[14]. Approximately 17,000 children are unaccompanied or separated[14], and 625,000 children have been out of school for a whole year[13].

General challenges affecting both women and children include the devastating impact of the conflict[14], with more than 41,000 people killed and 96,000 injured[11]. The destruction of Gaza's infrastructure has been catastrophic[19], with around 68% of cropland and roads either destroyed or severely damaged[12]. Only 17 of 36 hospitals remain partially functional[12], all suffering from a lack of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water[12]. Humanitarian aid movement in Gaza remains "very dangerous"[15]. The illegal blockade, deliberate isolation of Gaza, systematic deprivation of basic human rights, and deliberate destruction of essential services are long-standing crimes[20]. Thousands of bodies are still under rubble and in the streets, unreachable by rescue and medical teams[20]. Israel is also intentionally blocking deliveries of food and medicine[14].

Humanitarian organizations are addressing these challenges in several ways:
*   Oxfam partner Juzoor is supporting hundreds of thousands of people in over 90 shelters and health points across Gaza[11].
*   UNICEF has vaccinated thousands of children for polio in the area[11].
*   Oxfam is calling for an immediate, permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages and unlawfully detained Palestinians, and an end to all lethal arms sales to Israel[16].
*   Oxfam also demands full humanitarian access to Gaza[16]and urges the international community to enforce accountability by addressing the illegal Israeli occupation, removing settlements in the occupied West Bank, and providing reparations to affected Palestinian communities[16].

**Question:**  What are the reported levels of food insecurity in Gaza, and how are they being addressed by humanitarian organizations?
**Answer:** As of February 2024, 745,000 people are facing emergency levels of food insecurity[21], and 495,000 people are facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity[21]. There is a deliberate attempt to starve Gaza's population[30], with Israel reportedly intentionally blocking deliveries of food and medicine[30]. This has contributed to indirect deaths due to starvation[28].

Regarding efforts to address food insecurity, moving humanitarian aid in Gaza remains "very dangerous"[29], and aid convoys have been "continually blocked and even shot at"[23]. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) reported that Israel was intentionally blocking deliveries of food and medicine to Gaza[30]. Oxfam is calling for an immediate, permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages, an end to arms sales to Israel, and full humanitarian access to Gaza[25]. UNICEF's director stated confidence in meeting the needs, but noted it requires a "tremendous amount of effort"[29]. Oxfam partner Juzoor is supporting hundreds of thousands of people in over 90 health points and shelters across Gaza[27].

### Urgent Sanctions Needed: Addressing Dehumanization and Healthcare Crisis in Lebanon

**Question:**  How have international leaders and organizations reacted to the reported deaths and injuries of healthcare workers and the lack of medical supplies for critical procedures?
**Answer:** Signatory organizations consider the ongoing dehumanization of Lebanese civilians distressing, which includes health workers among the victims of bombings[1]. These organizations have urged governments to impose sanctions, such as an arms embargo on Israel, for its gross violations of international law[1]. Additionally, many commentators and public figures have remained silent or offered cursory hand-wringing, despite their countries' complicity, including through continued arms sales[4]. The sources report that at least 885 healthcare workers have been killed, and women have had caesarians and children amputations without anaesthetics[2].

### Israeli Offensive in Jabaliya Escalates Humanitarian Crisis and Food Scarcity in Gaza

**Question:**  What actions have Israeli forces taken in Jabaliya, and what are the implications for the local population?
**Answer:** Israeli forces have launched a new air and ground offensive in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza[1]. They have encircled Jabaliya and struck militant sites inside with warplanes[1]. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began a military operation in the Jabaliya refugee camp, striking several infrastructure facilities of Hamas[3]. They have eliminated dozens of military targets, including weapons depots, underground infrastructure facilities, and other military facilities, as well as a Hamas network operating in the area[3]. The IDF stated this operation to systematically dismantle terrorist infrastructure will continue as long as required[3].

These actions have several implications for the local population:
*   Jabaliya is home to a densely populated refugee camp[1].
*   Israel has reiterated its call for the complete evacuation of northern Gaza, where an estimated 300,000 people remained after earlier warnings[1].
*   An airstrike on a home in Jabaliya killed a dozen family members, including parents[4].
*   A Health Ministry medic was wounded and bleeding[4].
*   A local journalist was killed in artillery shelling on his home[4].
*   Military bulldozers destroyed over 500 dunums of newly replanted agricultural land, including eggplants, which was intended to sustain the needs of people in northern Gaza[6]. This destruction reflects Israel's intent to prevent the Palestinian people from relying on the region's agricultural food basket[6].
*   This has led to a severe famine, forcing a significant portion of people in the north to eat tree leaves and bake ground-up animal feed instead of flour[6].
*   People in northern Gaza are subject to an arbitrary siege and systematic starvation by Israel[6].

**Question:**  How has the conflict impacted the availability of essential services and resources, such as food and water, in Gaza?
**Answer:** The conflict has severely impacted the availability of essential services and resources in Gaza[19]. Hundreds of thousands of people lack proper access to basic necessities like food and clean water[17].

Regarding **food**:
*   The destruction of agricultural land and civilian infrastructure, including a road built by the Israeli military that split Gaza, has limited access to food[13].
*   Ongoing bombardments and fuel shortages have forced bakeries to shut down, limiting access to bread[14].
*   There is an almost total absence of fresh vegetables, fruit, and protein sources like poultry and meat in markets in Gaza City and across north Gaza[13].
*   Israel has systematically destroyed Gaza's food basket of fruits, vegetables, and meat, along with other components of local food production, and blocked the entry of food and humanitarian aid, resulting in famine[12].
*   Agricultural lands along the "security fence" have been bulldozed or destroyed, removing approximately 96 square kilometers[14].
*   An Israeli "buffer" road and zone, along with the Netzarim axis, have destroyed approximately three square kilometers of agricultural lands, representing the majority of agricultural land in the Gaza Strip, including hundreds of farms for vegetables, fruits, poultry, and livestock[14].
*   Additional land, at least 34 square kilometers of agricultural land and service streets, has been destroyed by Israeli incursions or bombardment outside this "buffer zone"[13].
*   The lack of electricity, destruction of water wells, and scarcity of fuel make it difficult to cultivate new areas and irrigate them[13].
*   Crops that people in northern Gaza depended on have been bulldozed, given Israel's restrictions on the entry of fruits and vegetables into northern Gazan markets[19].

Regarding **water**:
*   The contamination of soil and water resources may persist for years, hampering access to safe drinking water[14].
*   The intensive bombardment has damaged water infrastructure, leading to the mixing of sewage and potable water supplies[13].
*   The destruction of water wells makes it difficult to irrigate new areas[13].
*   The approaching rainy season will further deteriorate living conditions, putting hundreds of thousands at heightened risk of health hazards and limited access to essential services[17].
*   The UN and humanitarian partners have developed a Winterization Plan to address critical needs, including for over 850,000 people in flood-prone areas[19].
*   Planned interventions to enhance conditions in shelters, distribute materials, and install temporary drainage systems are hindered by the absence of unimpeded entry of humanitarian items, availability of fuel, and facilitation of safe humanitarian movement[15].
