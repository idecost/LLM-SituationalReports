# LandslideFloods-Week 31 2024 

## Summary 
India is grappling with severe natural calamities, primarily devastating landslides and heavy rainfall in Kerala's Wayanad district since the early hours of July 30th, alongside heavy rains impacting Delhi and the National Capital Region on August 1st[49]. In Wayanad, devastating landslides have resulted in at least 358 deaths and over 200 missing persons as of August 3rd, with earlier reports indicating 270 lives claimed and 378 missing by July 31st[92]. Thousands have been displaced, with over 11,000 individuals housed in 106 relief camps across Kerala[52]. The disaster has destroyed critical infrastructure, including a main bridge and hundreds of buildings, isolating many families and causing power outages[69]. Rescue operations are actively underway, involving the KSDMA, NDRF, army, police, and volunteers, utilizing helicopters, drones, and sniffer dogs, though efforts are challenged by continued heavy rains and blocked roads[34]. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued red alerts for extremely heavy rainfall in several Kerala districts, forecasting continued heavy showers[49]. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed distress and announced compensation for victims' families, while the Kerala government declared a state of mourning[1][57]. Experts attribute the increased frequency of such events to erratic monsoon patterns, climate change, and rapid, ecologically insensitive construction in the Western Ghats, emphasizing the urgent need for comprehensive action plans and improved early warning systems[42].

### Wayanad Rescue Operations Hindered by Terrain and Infrastructure Destruction

**Question:** What are the main challenges faced by rescue operations in the aftermath of the landslides in Wayanad district ?
**Answer:** Rescue operations in Wayanad district faced several challenges, including difficult terrain where rescue workers trekked knee-deep in muck[1]. Infrastructure was destroyed, with a bridge linking the affected forest area to the nearest town of Chooralmala being destroyed, necessitating the army to build a temporary or replacement crossing[5][6][7]. Locating victims was difficult as nearly 40 bodies were found 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the main landslide areas after being swept along the Chaliyar River[1][2]. People were also buried or swept away several miles downstream by torrents of mud, floodwater, and giant rolling boulders[1][3]. The catastrophic debris flows were extremely violent, making survival very difficult, especially since they struck before dawn when people were asleep in flimsy structures[8]. Additionally, large areas still needed to be explored and searched to find people[3].

### Kerala Rescue Operations Hindered by Landslides and Severe Weather Conditions

**Question:** What are the current challenges faced by the rescue teams in Kerala in accessing and evacuating affected areas ?
**Answer:** Rescue teams in Kerala face several challenges in accessing and evacuating affected areas. A main crossing linking the affected area was destroyed by landslides[2], and vehicles have been swept off roads and are stuck in a swollen river[2]. This necessitates the construction of a temporary bridge[2]and the evacuation of individuals by helicopter[5]. Incessant rains and adverse weather conditions have also prevented landing in the disaster area[7]. Furthermore, there is difficulty in understanding the situation in isolated areas, leading to requests for drones[7]. Swollen rivers and rivulets also pose a risk[7]. More rain is predicted throughout the day[2], with a possibility of heavy rains in the next 36 hours[7]. Timely evacuation measures are often lacking[5].

**Question:** What measures are being taken to monitor and respond to the potential for isolated thunderstorms and gusty winds in the region ?
**Answer:** According to the IMD, isolated thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds are expected over Kerala in the next three hours[11][12].

Measures being taken to monitor and respond include:
*   Implementing robust early warning systems through enhanced weather forecasting technologies to provide timely alerts[14].
*   The need for localised early warning systems and monitoring rainfall data in hotspots to prepare targeted early warning systems[13].
*   Weather department forecasts indicate the possibility of heavy rains[18].
*   The KSDMA has mobilized Fire force and NDRF teams to affected areas[11].
*   An NDRF team, along with two teams from the Kannur Defense Security Corps, are enroute, and two units of NDRF are expected to arrive in Wayanad[11].
*   Assistance from the army will be sought to construct a temporary bridge, evacuate individuals by helicopter, and establish necessary arrangements at the disaster site[11].
*   NDRF, Police, and Fire Brigade have carried out Search and Rescue operations[18].
*   Authorities have mobilized helicopters for rescue efforts, and the Indian army was involved in building a temporary bridge[18].
*   Mortuary facilities will be increased, mobile mortuary units utilized, medicines and equipment delivered to hospitals, and ambulances and rapid response units moved to the disaster-affected region[15].

**Question:** What additional resources or support are needed to enhance the ongoing search and rescue operations in Kerala ?
**Answer:** To enhance ongoing search and rescue operations in Kerala, additional resources and support are needed, including drones to understand the situation of isolated areas[28][29], and freezers to store unidentified dead bodies, as a shortage has been reported[22][28]. Furthermore, the implementation of effective early warning systems is a vital component of disaster management[25], with significant gaps remaining[23], and a need to prepare targeted early warning systems to save lives and livelihoods[23]. Urgent mitigation measures also need to be implemented[30], and a comprehensive action plan is required to address the growing frequency of natural calamities[24].

**Question:** How is the predicted rainfall over the next 36 hours expected to impact ongoing rescue operations and the stability of the affected areas ?
**Answer:** A possibility of heavy rains is forecast for the next 36 hours[31][34], with more rain predicted throughout the day[32]. Light to moderate rainfall, with occasional intense to very intense showers, isolated thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds, is also likely over Kerala in the next 03 hours[35]. Incessant rains and adverse weather conditions have already prevented planned visits to the disaster site due to an inability to land[31]. This shift to sudden, intense downpours heightens the risk of floods and makes landslides more likely, as dry soils are unable to absorb heavy rains effectively[38]. The area has already received heavy rain that softened the soil[37]. Kerala is prone to heavy rains, flooding, and landslides[38].

### Coordinated Rescue Efforts Underway in Kerala Amidst Widespread Infrastructure Damage

**Question:** What specific measures are being implemented to locate the 89 missing individuals reported by local authorities, and how are efforts being coordinated with the ongoing search for the additional 392 unaccounted individuals in Kerala ?

To locate these individuals, district authorities are collecting data[2], and rescue operations are being carried out by 500 to 600 personnel from the NDRF, Army, State Police, forest officials, and volunteers[3]. The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams are working tirelessly[1], with KSDMA mobilizing Fire force and NDRF teams to affected areas where hundreds are feared trapped under debris[1]. The Navy and Army have been deployed for rescue operations[5], including 225 Army personnel[6]. Two teams from the Kannur Defence Security Corps are assisting[7]. Tamil Nadu is sending a team of medical and disaster response personnel, including 329 fire and rescue officers, 35 water rescue trainers, and 85 Aapta Mitra personnel[5]. Two Air Force helicopters are scheduled to participate in search and rescue operations[8]. Additionally, the Health Department and National Health Mission have set up a control room and issued emergency helpline numbers[6].

To mitigate these challenges, various measures are being taken:
*   The Navy and Army have been deployed for rescue operations[13].
*   Tamil Nadu is sending a team of medical and disaster response personnel to Wayanad[13].
*   A total of 329 fire and rescue officers, including 35 water rescue trainers and 85 Aapta Mitra personnel, have been deployed[13].
