# Monsoon floods and rains in Pakistan-Week 31 2024 

## Summary 
Pakistan is currently grappling with widespread monsoon rains and flash floods, which between July 1 and August 1, led to 108 deaths, 216 injuries, and damage to over 550 houses, predominantly affecting Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Punjab provinces[10]. Urban flooding has been reported in various areas, with Lahore experiencing record rainfall that caused significant disruption, including electricity suspension, road closures, and submerged hospitals[13]. The floods have also damaged critical infrastructure such as bridges and roads, disrupting traffic in KP and Kashmir[10]. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued an "ALERT" for more torrential monsoon rains from August 1-6, warning of potential further flash flooding and landslides nationwide[14][17][18]. Simultaneously, the country is experiencing social unrest, including protests near the capital over escalating power bills and demonstrations in Balochistan concerning human rights, where hundreds have been detained and an internet shutdown imposed[25]. Additionally, a violent land dispute in Parachinar, Kurram, has resulted in significant casualties and a temporary ceasefire[15].

## Questions and Answers

### Monsoon Rains Fail to Deter Protests Over Pakistan's Rising Energy Costs

**Question:**  How have the monsoon rains affected the protests near Pakistan's capital, and what impact has this had on the humanitarian situation?
**Answer:** Despite pouring monsoon rains, approximately 3,000 supporters of a major Islamist party continued a sit-in protest on a main road into Pakistan's capital[1]. The provided sources do not contain information relevant to the impact of these specific monsoon rains or protests on the humanitarian situation in Pakistan.

**Question:**  What are the specific grievances of the protesters in Pakistan's southwest, and how are these related to the monsoon floods and rains?
**Answer:** In Pakistan's southwest, thousands protested against police violence, an internet shutdown, and highway closures[11]. The provided sources do not contain information linking these specific grievances to monsoon floods or rains.

**Question:**  What role has the monsoon season played in the recent protests against power bills in Pakistan, and how has this affected the local population's ability to cope with the increased costs?
**Answer:** The monsoon season is noted as a period during which protests over skyrocketing power bills continued, with some 3,000 supporters of a major Islamist party maintaining a sit-in despite pouring monsoon rains[41]. The provided sources do not directly link the monsoon season to the local population's ability to cope with the increased costs. However, the ability to cope has been affected by power bills that have more than doubled for some Pakistanis due to added taxes on top of the base price[41]. For instance, a private school teacher in Lahore stated that half of her salary now goes to the energy bill, making it difficult for her to manage household expenses[41].

### Pakistan Faces Dual Crisis: Malnutrition and Severe Monsoon Flooding Challenges

**Question:**  What are the current challenges faced by Pakistan in updating the National Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) guidelines to address the triple burden of malnutrition?
**Answer:** Pakistan is facing a triple burden of malnutrition, which includes very high levels of undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, increasing trends of overweight/obesity, and diet-related Non-Communicable Diseases[1]. There is a dire need to review and update the National Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) guidelines to align with the latest national and global recommendations, ensuring the quality and effectiveness of CMAM protocols, strategies, and implementation[1].

The provided sources do not explicitly state the current challenges faced by Pakistan in the process of updating these guidelines.

**Question:**  How have the monsoon rains affected the drainage systems and residential areas in Lahore, and what steps are being taken to mitigate these effects?
**Answer:** The monsoon rains have caused drainage systems in Lahore to become quickly overwhelmed, leading to the flooding of several residential areas[16]. Rainwater has entered numerous homes in various parts of the city[16]. Lahore received a record rainfall of 337 millimeters, which resulted in urban flooding, electricity suspension, road closures, and submerged hospitals and low-lying areas[14][18].

To mitigate these effects, efforts are underway to pump rainwater off main roads[15]. Wasa's drainage operation is continuing without interruption[16]. City and District Administrations are instructed to ensure contingency plans for flood-vulnerable urban centers, including prompt de-watering operations in flooded areas[20]. Rescuers across the province are actively working to help those in need[12]. Furthermore, NHA, FWO, and Local CW Departments are to ensure pre-placement of machinery and timely restoration of damaged road linkages[12].

**Question:**  How is the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) advising authorities to prepare for the potential urban flooding and landslides due to the ongoing monsoon rains?
**Answer:** The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued an advisory to concerned authorities[30]. This advisory instructs them to remain "ALERT"[27]and to take necessary measures to avoid any untoward situation[27]. The PMD predicts that torrential monsoon rains may generate flash flooding in local nullahs/streams and landslides, which could cause road closures in vulnerable hilly areas[21][27]. Heavy rainfall is also expected to cause further flooding[26].

**Question:**  How is the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) responding to the monsoon rains in Pakistan, and what measures are being implemented to mitigate the impact of potential urban flooding?
**Answer:** The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is responding to the monsoon rains in Pakistan by reporting on the impact of rain-related incidents, including casualties and damages[35]. The NDMA has warned that various parts of the country are likely to experience urban and flash flooding, with current and future rain spells projected[32]. It has also issued advisories stating that monsoon currents are expected to affect central and southern parts of the country, with heavy rainfall anticipated[33].

To mitigate the impact of potential urban flooding, efforts are underway to pump rainwater off main roads[38]. The NDMA advises populations at risk to avoid flood waters and seek safe locations[35]. Additionally, it recommends avoiding crossing bridges if water is flowing rapidly due to their hazardous nature during floods[31].

**Question:**  How is the National Emergencies Operation Centre addressing the risk of urban flooding in Punjab and Sindh, and what advice is being given to populations at risk?
**Answer:** The National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) is addressing the risk of urban flooding by forecasting rainfall and thundershowers in southern and northeastern Punjab and northeastern Sindh, which may trigger urban flooding in these regions[41]. Populations at risk are advised to avoid flood waters and find a safe location away from flood-prone areas[41]. Additionally, they are advised to ensure roofs and windows are properly sealed to prevent water leakage[41].

**Question:**  What are the predicted impacts of the sixth spell of monsoon rains in Punjab, and which districts are most likely to be affected by strong winds and thundershowers?
**Answer:** The sixth spell of monsoon rains in Punjab, predicted from August 1 to 6[51], is expected to bring strong winds and thundershowers[51]. Heavy rainfall during this period may cause further flooding[57]. Torrential monsoon rains are anticipated, which may generate flash flooding in local nullahs/streams and cause landslides leading to road closures in vulnerable hilly areas[56]. Intense rain-windstorms and thundershowers with heavy to very heavy rainfall are also expected in Punjab from August 1 to 7, 2024[59]. Most districts of south Punjab are most likely to face strong winds and thundershowers[51]. Monsoon rains are also expected in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur, Lahore, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, and Gujarat divisions[51].

### Pakistani Authorities Urged to Protect Protesters' Rights and Address Sectarian Violence

**Question:**  What role does the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) play in addressing the sectarian conflict and land disputes in Kurram District?
**Answer:** The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has voiced deep concern over the significant loss of life in Parachinar, Kurram, where rival tribes engaged in a violent land dispute fueling sectarian conflict[11][12]. The HRCP stated that this violence has severely impacted ordinary citizens, curtailing their freedom of movement and access to food and medical supplies[11]. The commission called on the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government to ensure that the brokered ceasefire holds[11]and urged the government to help broker peace in the area[12]. HRCP emphasized that all disputes, whether related to land or sectarian conflict, must be resolved peacefully through negotiations convened by the KP government with all stakeholders represented[11].
