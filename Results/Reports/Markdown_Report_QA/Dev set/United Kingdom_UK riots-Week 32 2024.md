# UK riots-Week 32 2024 

## Summary 
The United Kingdom is currently experiencing widespread far-right riots, which were sparked by misinformation spread online regarding a stabbing attack in Southport that falsely identified the suspect as an immigrant and a Muslim[59]. These disturbances, which began on August 30 in Southport and escalated across towns and cities including Liverpool, Hull, Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, Sheffield, Sunderland, Middlesbrough, and Rotherham, involve racist attacks, looting, damage to public buildings, cars being set on fire, and assaults on police officers, Black, and Asian people[26]. Over 400 arrests have been made, with dozens of police officers injured, and some rioters have already received jail terms[37]. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned the events as "far-right thuggery" and vowed to bring those responsible to justice, including those spreading false information online[80]. In response, thousands of anti-racism protesters have taken to the streets across the UK, often outnumbering would-be rioters and helping to calm fears of extreme-right disorder[75]. Despite this, police remain on alert for further unrest, particularly targeting immigration centers, lawyers, and services, and Muslim and minority ethnic communities continue to feel fearful[68]. The UK government has also criticized Elon Musk for "deeply irresponsible" comments on social media regarding a potential "civil war"[88].

## Questions and Answers

### Urgent Need for Regulation of Facial Recognition Technology in UK Policing

**Question:**  What are the concerns raised about the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement, and how does this relate to issues of privacy and democratic accountability?
**Answer:** Concerns about the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement include its intrusive nature[2]and its capability to achieve complete societal surveillance[2]. It can create significant injustice, particularly when deployed in real time, due to an increased risk of false positive matches where members of the public are incorrectly identified and flagged to police or security staff[2]. There are "human dangers of believing in the infallibility of the machine"[5], and misidentification has occurred[4].

Regarding privacy, the technology is described as "incredibly intrusive"[2]and capable of "total societal surveillance"[2]. Facial images are gathered en masse via CCTV cameras, the passport database, and the internet[1]. Live facial recognition depends on cameras in public places that capture everyone who passes by[2].

In terms of democratic accountability, there is no specific law governing how police are authorized to use this technology[2]. It has been used on streets without significant public debate or parliamentary authorization[1], a situation contrasted with regulated powers like telephone taps or DNA retention[1]. The police and government have been silent on this "legal black hole"[6]. The technology has profound implications for democratic accountability[4], with concerns about "unaccountable contracts for intrusive technology that replaces legal code with opaque computer code"[6]. There is a call for parliamentary process and primary legislation to regulate these technologies, similar to how international partners like Europe, which bans live facial recognition except in extreme circumstances, do[2][5].

**Question:**  What strategies are being considered to improve social cohesion in areas affected by riots, and how might these strategies address the underlying issues of misinformation and extremism?
**Answer:** The government needs to develop a proper social cohesion strategy, especially since most of the 2011 riots occurred in areas ranking in the bottom 10 on measures of social cohesion[11]. Cohesion is a much broader concept than integration[11]. Extremists use disinformation and conspiracy theories to attract and provoke people online, which creates a challenging context for the Prevent programme aimed at preventing radicalisation into various forms of extremism[11]. The provided sources do not detail specific strategies for improving social cohesion or how these strategies would address the underlying issues of misinformation and extremism, beyond acknowledging the challenging context[19].

**Question:**  What are the implications of using live facial recognition technology in public spaces in the UK, and how does this practice align with existing legal frameworks and public accountability measures?
**Answer:** The use of live facial recognition (LFR) technology in public spaces in the UK is considered "incredibly intrusive"[21]and capable of achieving "complete societal surveillance"[21]. It can create "significant injustice," especially when deployed in real-time[21], and increases the "risk of false positive matches" where members of the public are "incorrectly identified and flagged to police or security staff"[21]. There are "human dangers of believing in the infallibility of the machine"[23], which can lead to misidentification[23]. This "total societal surveillance" is viewed as a "dangerous and poor substitute for intelligence-led community cooperation and policing"[26].

Regarding legal frameworks and public accountability, there is "no specific law governing how the police, or private companies such as retailers, are authorised to use this technology"[21]. The technology has been used on UK streets "without any significant public debate or any parliamentary authorisation"[22]. Unlike telephone taps, DNA retention, or stop and search powers, LFR is "unregulated by the law"[22]. This situation is described as a "legal black hole"[21], on which the police and government have been "silent"[26]. The UK does not have a similar ban on live facial recognition as seen in Europe's AI Act, which prohibits its use except in extreme circumstances[23]. The Conservative government has been characterized as "casual with both the law and the doling out of public money to private contractors" concerning facial recognition[22], resulting in "unaccountable contracts for intrusive technology"[21]. There is a call for "parliamentary process and primary legislation" to address this[21]. Despite these concerns, Keir Starmer has pledged to "increase the use of live facial recognition technology"[24].

### UK Government Tackles Far-Right Riots Amidst Civil Liberties Concerns

**Question:**  What are the key challenges faced by the UK government in balancing the enforcement of law and order with the protection of civil liberties during the recent riots and protests?
**Answer:** The UK government faces challenges in balancing law enforcement with the protection of civil liberties during recent riots and protests. Protest is not illegal, and freedom of expression and assembly are protected rights under the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), which the UK is beholden to[5]. Police can lawfully intervene when an assembled group becomes violent or begins to carry out unlawful acts[5].

The police's approach is to enable peaceful protests, while robustly dealing with individuals who are intent on committing public order or criminal offenses[5]. Violence and hate will not be tolerated[3].

Additional challenges include implementing effective and humane policies that appease both sides of the political spectrum[3]. The government has also faced significant criticism for its handling of the crisis[8], including accusations of failing to center Muslim people or call out racism for what it is[5].

**Question:**  What role have social media platforms played in the organization and escalation of the far-right riots in the UK, and what actions are being taken to mitigate their influence?
**Answer:** Social media platforms have played a significant role in the organization and escalation of the far-right riots in the UK by fueling them with racist and Islamophobic misinformation shared online[11]. Misinformation about a stabbing rampage, including falsely identifying the suspect as an immigrant and a Muslim, spread via social media users[18]. Far-right groups used social media to claim the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker[12]. This misinformation was circulated organically and amplified by platform algorithms, even after police confirmed the false identity[12]. Lists of target addresses for far-right protests circulated on Telegram channels and then across social media for days[16][17]. Messages inviting people to "mask up" if attending were also shared[11].

To mitigate their influence, policymakers' minds should be focused on how easily these platforms can be harnessed to promote hate[11]. The "misguided and ignorant interventions" of X (formerly Twitter) owner Elon Musk have raised questions about platform management, with parliamentarians suggesting Musk be called to answer questions[11]. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has also warned those "whipping up this disorder online"[15].

**Question:**  How are local communities in the UK, particularly those affected by the riots, responding to the violence and what support mechanisms are in place to assist them?
**Answer:** Local communities in the UK have responded to the violence by overwhelmingly condemning the riots[22]. Anti-racist demonstrators have massively outnumbered would-be rioters[30], with thousands of anti-racism protesters taking to the streets across the UK to counter far-right rallies[24]. This "show of unity from communities together" has been credited with defeating the challenges seen[29]. For example, a sizeable counter-protest in Walthamstow demonstrated that when people come out to support, the numbers of those causing violence dwindle[25]. Anti-racism rallies have "stole[n] back the narrative and kept away far-right antagonists"[25]. Communities have also shown utmost solidarity to people of colour and Muslim communities[26]. Reports have emerged of violent counterattacks in some areas[28].

Regarding support mechanisms, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that the government's first duty is to ensure communities are safe[21][22], and that "where support is needed for particular places, that is in place"[21][22]. A "markedly stronger police presence" has been noted during counter-protests[22], with nearly 4,000 additional officers deployed[24]. A government order also granted officers in some places special powers to disperse gatherings or "antisocial behaviour"[25]. Riot police are expected to remain on standby for the "foreseeable future"[21].

**Question:**  How has the response from law enforcement, including the deployment of 6,000 specialist police officers, impacted the level of violence and disorder during the recent far-right riots in the UK?
**Answer:** The government put 6,000 specially trained police on standby to respond to any disorder[31][35]. Police across the UK had braced for widespread disorder, but these demonstrations failed to materialize as police and counter-protesters filled the streets[35]. Police reported that protests and counter-protests were largely peaceful[35]. Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of London's Metropolitan Police Service, stated that the "show of force from the police" combined with community unity "defeated the challenges" faced[32][35]. Fears of extreme-right disorder had been calmed[37], and fears of another night of unrest abated for now due to a "markedly stronger police presence"[34]. British authorities applauded the efforts of police who largely stifled a threatened wave of far-right demonstrations[35].

### UK Government Addresses Social Media's Role in Inciting Riot Violence

**Question:**  What role has social media played in the dissemination of information and misinformation during the UK riots, and how is the UK government planning to address the challenges posed by online platforms in this context?
**Answer:** Social media has played a role in the dissemination of information and misinformation during the UK riots[2]. Elon Musk, owner of X, drew criticism for his "unacceptable" and "deeply irresponsible" comments on the platform[2]. He wrote that a British "civil war" was inevitable[2]and amplified anti-immigrant rhetoric, which highlights the role that false information spread online is playing in fomenting real-world violence[1]. Musk also appeared to repeat conspiracy theories, including the "two-tier" claim that police are afraid to tackle violent Muslim demonstrators[4], and posted an image suggesting future punishment for Facebook comments disliked by the UK government[2]. He also shared a tweet comparing the treatment of alleged rapists with false information[4]. A speaker at a counter-protest criticized Musk, stating he was "stirring the pot for a race war"[10].

The UK government has vowed to bring those responsible for the riots, as well as their "online cheerleaders," to justice[1]. As part of this, a 28-year-old man was charged with using "threatening words or behavior intending to stir up racial hatred" online, related to alleged Facebook posts[1]. A UK government minister slammed Musk's comments as "unacceptable"[2].

**Question:**  How have the UK riots been characterized in terms of their impact on public safety and property, and what specific incidents have been reported in relation to these events?
**Answer:** The UK riots have been characterized by real-world violence[11]. Rioters have damaged public buildings, set cars on fire, and hurled bricks at police officers[11]. Neil Basu, former head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, stated that some of the rioting had "crossed the line into terrorism"[13]. Police officers have described attending a "mass stabbing of little girls" and subsequently having bricks thrown at them while on duty in riot gear[15].

In relation to these events, a 28-year-old man in Leeds, northern England, was charged with using "threatening words or behavior intending to stir up racial hatred" online, with the charges relating to "alleged Facebook posts"[11].

**Question:**  What legal actions have been taken by the UK authorities against individuals accused of inciting racial hatred online, and how do these actions relate to the broader context of the riots and social media influence?
**Answer:** The UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) charged a 28-year-old man in Leeds, northern England, with using "threatening words or behavior intending to stir up racial hatred" online[21]. This individual was the first person to be charged in this context[28]. The charges were related to "alleged Facebook posts"[21].

These actions relate to the broader context of riots where rioters have damaged public buildings, set cars on fire, and hurled bricks at police officers[21]. The UK government views the spread of false information online as playing a role in fomenting real-world violence[21]. They have vowed to bring those responsible for the riots, as well as their online cheerleaders, to justice[21].

### British Government Forms Specialist Police Unit to Address 2024 Riots

**Question:**  How has the British government's response, including the establishment of a "standing army" of specialist police, impacted the scale and intensity of the riots?
**Answer:** The British government has announced a "standing army" of specialist police to deal with rioting[1]. The government is struggling to quell the unrest[1]. The prompt arrest of many rioters, with some already sentenced to long prison terms, has undoubtedly had a deterrent effect[2]. Serious offenses carrying heavy maximum sentences may also have an immediate deterrent effect[4]. What has been seen so far remains on a much smaller scale than the England riots of 2011[2].

**Question:**  How does the poverty rate in Sunderland, as reported by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, compare to the national average, and what role might this disparity play in the unrest?
**Answer:** According to the most recent report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 35 percent of children in Sunderland are living in poverty, which is significantly higher than the national average of 29 percent[11].

Regarding the role this disparity might play in the unrest, some sources indicate that wider inequalities and high levels of deprivation in cities and towns gave rise to the unrest[13], with Britain in 2024 being one of the most unequal societies in Europe[11]. These issues, including "deep-rooted inequalities" in housing, education, and wealth, have occurred in tandem with the cost of living crisis[12]. Some suggest that people experiencing grievances project negative feelings onto an "other," and these existing grievances became an opportunity for violence[15].

However, other sources explicitly state that the riots of 2024 were not born of "legitimate grievances" about poverty, underinvestment, and the breakdown of basic services[18]. Instead, they assert that the motivations for these riots were racism and nativism[17], and that the 2024 riots are fundamentally different from past protests against poverty[12].

### London's Community Response to Racism and Islamophobia: Strengthening Safety and Unity

**Question:** What measures can be implemented to ensure the safety and well-being of Muslims and minority ethnic communities in London amidst rising fears of racism and violence?
**Answer:** To ensure the safety and well-being of Muslims and minority ethnic communities, several measures can be implemented:

Londoners are asked to check on their friends and neighbors and show them care and compassion[1][2]. London has a zero-tolerance policy for racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism, or any form of hate[1][2]. Those involved in disorder will feel the full force of the law[2].

More broadly, Nigerians in the UK are encouraged to shut down online rhetoric perpetuated by "racist hoodlums" and far-right influencers[8]. Communities are urged to come together, support their neighbors and community, and safeguard and protect each other, especially the most vulnerable[1]. This includes communities rallying against the far right and supporting one another[10], demonstrating kindness, love, and compassion[1]. There is also a call for Muslim women's resistance to be highlighted[5].

Additionally, there is a call for gendered Islamophobia to be acknowledged as a specific form of violence against women and girls at the highest levels of government[5]. Specialist services are also called upon to advocate for the safety of Muslim women and girls[5]. Citizens are encouraged to stand up to racism and Islamophobia and push back on divisive rhetoric[5]. Lobbying the government is also a measure to resist hateful forces[10].

**Question:** What steps are being taken by law enforcement agencies to address allegations of racism and Islamophobia within their ranks, and how are they working to build trust with affected communities?
**Answer:** The provided sources state that the police are considered "part of the problem" and are accused of being Islamophobes, misogynists, and racists[12]. In London, there is a stated "zero-tolerance for racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism or any form of hate"[13][19]. Peterborough's MP Andrew Pakes thanked the police for working tirelessly to keep everyone safe[14]. However, the sources do not contain information detailing specific steps being taken by law enforcement agencies to address allegations of racism and Islamophobia within their ranks, nor how they are working to build trust with affected communities.

**Question:** How effective have police interventions been in managing the riots and ensuring public safety, and what improvements can be made?
**Answer:** Police officers were present in fireproof riot gear, standing stoic with their shields as explosives popped at their feet[27]. However, anti-fascist protesters were overwhelmed early on and kettled by the violent far-right mob[27]. The "shocking scenes" left many Muslims and minority ethnic communities scared and fearful[26], with people afraid to leave their homes due to attacks and beatings[23]. In Peterborough, the MP thanked the police, along with faith leaders and the city council, for working tirelessly to keep everyone safe[22].

Regarding improvements, one perspective suggests that relying solely on the police is not the answer, as they are seen by some as "part of the problem" due to being "Islamophobes, misogynists and racists"[21]. It is also stated that London has "zero-tolerance for racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism or any form of hate"[24], and those involved in disorder will feel the full force of the law[24].

**Question:**  What strategies are being employed to engage in dialogue and reduce tensions between different community groups in areas affected by the riots and protests?
**Answer:** One strategy involves people coming together to talk and listen, which can lead to discovering shared concerns[36]. This process, which requires human interaction, is exemplified by a plan to open a mosque's gates to engage in discussions with members of the far right[31].

**Question:** How can community leaders and organizations counteract the influence of extremist narratives that exploit disillusionment and scapegoat minority groups?
**Answer:** Community leaders and organizations can counteract extremist narratives by encouraging people to shut down rhetoric perpetuated online by "racist hoodlums" and far-right influencers, not allowing their lies to spread[58]. They can condemn ongoing violence[55]and lobby the government[52]. Communities can rally against the far right, supporting one another[52], and come together to support each other with kindness, love, and compassion, based on shared humanity[52]. There is a need to shine a light on resistance[52].

Organizations like The Three Hijabis call on specialist services to advocate for the safety of Muslim women and girls and to stand up for all women and communities[56]. Leaders also state that plans for upcoming rallies "needs to be stopped"[55], that organized crime and racism need to be "nipped in the bud"[60], and that such events must be prevented from happening again[55].

Furthermore, leaders can stand up to racism and Islamophobia and push back on divisive rhetoric[56]. Faith leaders, the police, and city councils can work to keep everyone safe and reject hate[54]. Communities are encouraged to come together, support neighbors, safeguard, and protect each other, especially the most vulnerable[52]. London has a zero-tolerance policy for racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism, or any form of hate[57], and Londoners are asked to show care and compassion to friends and neighbors[57]. Kindness and understanding can also be shown[55].

### Escalating Far-Right Protests in UK Towns: Social Media's Role and Risks

**Question:**  In what ways have social media platforms been utilized to mobilize rioters in towns such as Southport, Sunderland, and Stoke, and what impact has this had on social cohesion?
**Answer:** In towns such as Southport, Sunderland, and Stoke, hundreds of rioters were mobilized through social media[1]. These protests were often planned organically by local people who are connected to decentralized far-right networks online[2]. Modern technology, particularly social media, enables individuals to collaborate towards common political goals independently of traditional organizational structures[2]. Social media posts claiming action in many locations appeared to instigate these events[6]. Following a stabbing in Southport, a broadcast channel titled 'Southport Wake Up' was set up on the messaging app Telegram[4]. The far-right now uses interlinked networks and Telegram chats to move seamlessly between groups, driving these protests[4]. Nigel Farage's manipulation of social media also contributes to the merging of different far-right elements[5]. The spread of misinformation online is a factor that needs to be examined[8].

This mobilization has challenged Britain's peaceful multi-ethnic identity[1]. Ineffective legislation permits pernicious racist narratives to be freely propagated, especially on social media, which needs to be addressed in extremism laws[3]. The mainstreaming of far-right discourse on immigration is a political fact requiring a response to defend Britain's multicultural society[3]. By adopting far-right rhetoric, politicians have normalized Islamophobia and xenophobia, emboldening extremists[10]. This has led to a divided country where the far right is a real and present danger[10]. Misinformation about how the state handles unrest risks stoking further tensions[1]. There is a need for a more serious approach to integration, social cohesion, and counter-extremism, as these issues have been neglected[9]. Building a resilient multi-ethnic society requires concerted work on societal cohesion and greater responsibility and accuracy from journalists and politicians when discussing immigration, asylum seekers, and the Muslim community[8].

### UK Riots: Law Enforcement Challenges, Government Response, and Community Impact

**Question:**  What challenges have law enforcement agencies faced in managing the riots, and what strategies are being employed to improve their response to such incidents?
**Answer:** Law enforcement agencies have faced several challenges in managing the riots, including dozens of police officers being injured, with rioters often targeting them[7]. In South Belfast, riot officers had stones and petrol bombs thrown at them[2], and in Rotherham, rioters used wooden planks and fire extinguishers against officers[2]. Public opinion has been split on the police's use of force[4], and while a slight majority believe the police are handling the riots well, confidence in their ability to prevent further violence is low[3]. The impression of "two-tier policing" has become widespread[7], and misinformation spread on social media has played a prominent role in inciting violence[8].

To improve their response, several strategies are being employed:
*   **Increased arrests and severe processing:** More than 3,000 people have been arrested[8], with 428 men arrested in the UK[8]. Courts are denying bail for those awaiting trial[4], and emergency legislation was introduced to open courts for 24 hours[4]. Sentences have been 25 percent higher than usual on average[4], with the first jail terms being issued, some as severe as three years[8].
*   **Strong stance from leadership:** Sir Keir Starmer has held a strong line, stating that rioters are engaging in criminal acts and will be punished[3]. He has warned that anyone involved, including those inciting violence online, will face "the full force of the law"[5][6].
*   **Deployment of specialist police officers:** The government has assembled a "standing army" of 6,000 specialist police officers to respond to outbreaks of violence[2].
*   **Increased protection for targeted communities:** Mosques in the United Kingdom are being offered "greater protection with new emergency security"[2].
*   **Coordination of response:** Prime Minister Keir Starmer has held meetings of the government's COBRA emergency response committee to coordinate the crisis response[2].
*   **Community unity:** Police chiefs have praised the "show of unity from communities" and "crowds of citizens" for helping to defeat the challenges[9].

**Question:**  What measures have been taken by the UK government and law enforcement to address the violence and prevent further unrest, and how effective have these measures been?
**Answer:** The UK government and law enforcement have taken several measures to address the violence and prevent further unrest. These include widespread arrests, with 428 men arrested in the UK[11][20]and over 370 people arrested following weekend violence, a number expected to rise[12]. More than 3,000 people were arrested during the disorder[15]. Those arrested for violence and incitement are remanded in custody[20], and bail has been denied for all awaiting trial[15]. Courts are expediting trials for those pleading guilty with overwhelming evidence[20], and the first jail terms, some as severe as three years, are being issued[20]. Sentences have been 25 percent higher than usual on average[15], and emergency legislation was introduced to open courts for 24 hours[15]. Authorities have pledged to use facial recognition and other technologies to track down suspects[12].

The government has also taken steps to protect communities, with mosques in the UK being offered "greater protection with new emergency security"[11]. Police, city hall, and community leaders are working to protect targeted buildings and places of worship[16][17]. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has held COBRA emergency response committee meetings[13], describing the crisis as "far-right thuggery" and stating that those involved will "feel the full force of the law"[11].

Regarding the effectiveness of these measures, public opinion is divided. A slight majority (52%) believe the police are handling the riots well[13], and a human rights charity, Liberty, considered the police's use of force "proportionate"[11]. However, confidence in the police's ability to prevent further violence is low[11]. Public satisfaction with Keir Starmer's handling of the crisis is low, with only 31% believing he is doing well, while 49% think he is doing poorly[11]. Similarly, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has a 23% approval rating for her handling, against 43% disapproval[19]. More than a week after the initial violence, Britain is still only at the beginning of an agreed and effective response[11], and history suggests that preventing further unrest remains a significant challenge[13].

**Question:**  How has the UK government coordinated with local authorities and community leaders to ensure the protection of targeted buildings and places of worship during the riots?
**Answer:** London Mayor Sadiq Khan stated that the police, city hall, and community leaders were working to protect targeted buildings and places of worship[21][22][23]. Additionally, the Home Office announced that mosques in the United Kingdom were being offered "greater protection with new emergency security"[24].

**Question:**  How have the UK riots affected minority communities, particularly Muslims and asylum seekers, in terms of safety and community cohesion?
**Answer:** The UK riots have significantly impacted minority communities, particularly Muslims and asylum seekers, in terms of safety and community cohesion.

**Safety Impacts:**
Minority communities, including Muslims and asylum seekers, have experienced fear and direct attacks[34]. Rioters have clashed with police and smashed windows of hotels housing asylum-seekers, chanting "get them out" and "stop the boats"[32]. Mosques have been pelted with rocks, terrifying local communities[32]. These shocking scenes have left many Muslims and minority ethnic communities scared and fearful[36]. At least one person has been seriously injured due to racist and Islamophobic attacks, which include stabbings, street beatings, and mosques under siege[33]. Violent unrest, fueled by misinformation, has left communities feeling unsafe[35]. A single mother reported hiding inside her apartment as people shouted obscenities and threw bricks at a neighboring building[35]. Muslim businesses have been torched, ethnic minority members of the public attacked, and chants of "Pakis out" heard[34]. An American Pakistani friend even questioned whether her family should cancel their flight to London[37]. Muslim women are attending prayers less and exchanging safety tips like moving in groups, avoiding crowds, and keeping car windows closed[38]. Everyone, including minorities, feels scared and attacked[32]. Asylum seekers have expressed worry about their wellbeing and inability to travel to appointments[37]. Refugee support centers have contacted police about reported threats and planned protests[38]. The wide circulation of target lists has caused distress, unease, and fear within Muslim and immigrant communities[31]. There are concerns about serious violence, similar to an incident where rioters tried to set fire to a hotel housing asylum seekers[38]. An 88-year-old grandmother's address was included on a target list because a family member, an immigration advisor, uses her house as a registered business address[35]. Some individuals feel they are "probably safer in a despotic regime in the Middle East than here"[39]. In response, police, city hall, and community leaders are working to protect targeted buildings and places of worship[36]. Some businesses, like real estate agents and pubs, have shut down early or not opened due to potential protests[36].

**Community Cohesion Impacts:**
The riots have also impacted community cohesion, with xenophobic and bigoted views, particularly against Muslims and asylum seekers, becoming more normalized[34]. Far-right extremism is seen as a threat to Britain's way of life, peace, safety, and thriving diversity[33]. Some Muslims question their sense of belonging in the UK[33], with one individual stating, "We have become second-class citizens in our own country"[38]. The unrest is partially attributed to feelings of "denied freedoms" and perceived risks to British "sovereignty," alongside emerging feelings of nationalism[31]. Despite commentary loosely attributing the riots to poor integration, the UK generally performs well on certain integration measures, showing sustained intergenerational falls in prejudice, gradual decreases in residential segregation, and second-generation immigrant children outperforming non-immigrant children at school[31]. However, community cohesion is undermined by economic hardship[31], and the government lacks a framework to measure it or an evidence base on what works[31]. Incidents have been dealt with poorly by local authorities, such as the treatment of a teacher in Batley[31]. On a positive note, the events have brought forth an abundance of goodwill and solidarity, with different communities uniting against racism and thuggery[31]. Examples include people cleaning up after a mosque attack in Southport, an imam launching a crowdfunder in Liverpool, and thousands voicing unity against hate in anti-racism demonstrations[38]. Minority communities now have traumatic memories to process[36].
