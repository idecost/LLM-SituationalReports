# Flooding in Nigeria-Week 37 2024 

## Summary 
Borno State, Nigeria, is grappling with severe flooding, described as the worst in 30 years, primarily caused by heavy rainfall and the collapse or overflow of the Alau Dam on the Ngadda River around September 10, 2024[72]. This disaster has affected over 414,000 people as of September 11, 2024, with more than 230,000 to 400,000 individuals displaced and registered in relocation sites[46]. At least 37 people have died and 58 sustained injuries[1], while thousands of homes, infrastructure, schools, hospitals, and markets have been submerged or their access hampered, with 15% to 50% of Maiduguri city underwater[9]. The flooding exacerbates a pre-existing humanitarian crisis, including armed conflict, widespread malnutrition, and a failing economy, occurring during the lean season and leading to shortages of food and water, alongside a heightened risk of disease outbreaks like cholera and malaria[75]. In response, evacuation of high-risk areas is ongoing, and search and rescue operations are underway by government agencies, military, and local divers[52]. The UN and its partners, including WFP, UNICEF, and WHO, are providing emergency food assistance, hot meals, shelter, water, health services, and hygiene kits, while appealing for additional support to address the escalating humanitarian crisis[18]. Although floodwaters are beginning to recede in some areas, many residents' homes remain flooded, and the overall situation requires immediate action[46].
