# Ukraine-Week 23 2024 

## Summary 
Ukraine is experiencing a multifaceted crisis characterized by ongoing hostilities and significant humanitarian challenges. The Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS) continues to monitor the status of health facilities and identify service gaps[79], while nuclear safety and security, particularly at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), remain vulnerable with frequent external power outages and only one of four 750 kV power lines operational[28]. The country is still recovering from the Kakhovka Dam destruction a year prior, which resulted in devastating flooding, at least 15 deaths, damage to over 37,000 houses, and disrupted water supply for a million people[83]. Education activities in regions like Sumska, Donetska, and Kharkivska oblasts aim to restore normalcy for children amidst displacement and intensified missile attacks, with educational consultation points in Donetska oblast temporarily suspended and evacuations of families with children initiated in May 2024 due to worsening security[89][90]. Telecommunications infrastructure has also been severely affected, including a major cyberattack in December 2023 that disrupted mobile signals for millions, and temporary internet services were deployed in Odesa in May due to intensified shelling[49]. Economically, direct damage to Ukraine has reached USD 155 billion, with economic losses at USD 499 billion, and reconstruction efforts are estimated to cost over USD 486 billion[87]. Efforts are underway to address legal issues such as housing compensation[92]and provide mental health and psychosocial support to over 117,000 people[46], with calls for women's inclusive participation in reconstruction processes[5].

## Questions and Answers

### Legal Barriers Impede Compensation for Destroyed Housing in Occupied Ukraine Territories

**Question:**  What are the current legal challenges faced by owners of destroyed housing in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, and how do these challenges impact their ability to receive compensation through the eRecovery program?
**Answer:** Owners of destroyed housing in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine face several legal challenges that impact their ability to receive compensation through the eRecovery program.

**Legal Challenges:**
*   **Difficulty in Property Registration:** Most Bureaus of Technical Inventory (BTIs) in temporarily occupied territories were not relocated to Government of Ukraine-controlled territory, or were damaged, destroyed, or looted, making it very difficult or impossible to obtain necessary information for state registration of property rights (SRPR)[3][5][6]. The law obliges state registrars to receive information from BTIs for state registration of rights[5][6]. Owners who acquired ownership before 2013 specifically face problems registering their rights in the SRPR, even with hard copies of title documents[4][6]. As a result, these owners often have to undergo a judicial procedure to recognize their right of ownership, which involves paying a court fee and bearing the burden of proof[3][8].
*   **Inheritance Issues:** Notaries commonly refuse to open inheritance cases for property located in temporarily occupied territory, likely due to potential legal responsibility[8][9]. This forces heirs to apply to the court to confirm ownership in the order of inheritance, also requiring them to pay a court fee and bear the burden of proof[8][9].

**Impact on eRecovery Compensation:**
*   **Pre-condition for Application:** Registration of property rights in the SRPR is a pre-condition to apply for compensation through the eRecovery program[4][6]. The aforementioned difficulties in registration directly impede an owner's ability to meet this requirement.
*   **Program Scope Limitation:** The eRecovery program would provide compensation for housing in temporarily occupied territories *only* in cases of destruction, because determining the degree of damage to housing based on satellite images is not possible[4][6].
*   **Program Expansion Status:** While there are plans to expand the eRecovery program to other temporarily occupied territories, including Mariupol and Bakhmut[1][2], these plans are likely subject to funding support[2]. A relevant draft law is registered in the Parliament (Verkhovna Rada) and is preparing for the second reading[4].

**Question:**  In what ways are the services and housing stock in Ukraine's Oblasts under stress due to increased demand, and how does this relate to the regions where the Government of Ukraine (GoU) is regaining control?
**Answer:** Services and housing stock, although functional, are under stress due to increased demand[11]. This situation is present in virtually every Oblast of the country[11]. This context relates to areas where the Government of Ukraine (GoU) is regaining control, which are regions that have been under occupation and on the frontlines of war, where infrastructure and services have been severely affected[11].

**Question:**  What measures are being considered to address the increased demand for technical documentation and cadastral numbers for horticultural land plots in temporarily occupied territories, and how are these measures expected to alleviate the current backlog?
**Answer:** The number of requests for technical documentation and cadastral numbers for plots of land for horticulture has increased rapidly[21][22]. To address this, the legislator initiated amendments to the Law on land plots allocation[21][26]. These amendments extend the deadline for registering the ownership of a land plot from 1 January 2025 to 1 January 2028[21][26]. These amendments have been passed in the parliament and are awaiting the Presidential signature[26]. This extension is expected to alleviate the backlog by providing owners and heirs more time to register their land ownership, preventing the land from being considered free and sold by the state if not registered by the earlier deadline[21][26].

**Question:**  How does the lack of access to information from the Bureau of Technical Inventory (BTI) in temporarily occupied territories impact the ability of property owners to register their rights and apply for compensation?
**Answer:** The law obliges state registrars to receive information necessary for state registration of rights from the relevant Bureau of Technical Inventory (BTI)[31][32]. However, most BTIs in temporarily occupied territories were not relocated to Ukrainian government-controlled territory, and some were damaged, destroyed, or looted, making it very difficult and generally impossible to obtain information from them[32][34]. As registration of property rights in the State Register of Property Rights (SRPR) is a precondition to apply for compensation[31][33], the inability to obtain BTI information forces owners to undergo a judicial procedure to recognize their right of ownership, which involves paying a court fee and bearing the burden of proof[34].

### Emergency Internet Services Deployed in Odesa; Zaporizhzhya Plant Faces Power Crisis

**Question:**  What measures did the ETC take to provide temporary internet connectivity services in Odesa in response to intensified shelling, and how effective were these measures in supporting the affected community?
**Answer:** In response to an urgent request from local authorities in Odesa due to intensified shelling, the ETC set up temporary internet connectivity services from May 7 to 8[1][2]. These services were provided for registration points and tents opened by local authorities to support affected people[1][2]. The ETC utilized its existing Remote Site on Vehicle (RSoV) and satellite solutions to deliver the service[1][3][5]. By May 9, all community members were registered using the new network, and the ETC service concluded[1][3].

**Question:**  What are the current challenges and plans for repairing and maintaining the power lines connected to the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), and how is this affecting the plant’s operations?
**Answer:** The Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) faces significant challenges with its power lines and external power situation[21]. The plant's electricity grid has been severely impacted by the conflict, leading to repeated losses of connections to all its power lines[21]. The external power situation is extremely vulnerable and prone to frequent outages[21]. Before the conflict, ZNPP had four 750 kV lines available, but only one remains[22]. The line itself is unavailable due to damage sustained earlier in the conflict, away from the site[22].

Regarding repair plans, the ZNPP is not currently planning to complete repairs at this time[22].

These issues affect the plant's operations as a loss of off-site power has the potential to be more serious due to higher nuclear fuel temperatures for reactors in operation in Ukraine[21]. Director General Grossi reiterated that the ZNPP would not be re-started as long as nuclear safety and security remained in jeopardy due to the conflict[21]. However, IAEA experts were informed that nuclear safety and security is being maintained despite the ongoing conflict[22].

### Revitalizing Irrigation and Healthcare Amidst Kakhovka Dam Disaster in Ukraine

**Question:**  What specific interventions are being considered to revitalize irrigation systems in areas affected by the Kakhovka Dam's destruction, and how might these interventions increase vegetable and fruit production?
**Answer:** Targeted activities to revitalize irrigation systems are being examined[1]. These interventions could increase vegetable and fruit production, especially in areas affected by the Kakhovka Dam's destruction in 2023[1].

**Question:**  What are the primary healthcare challenges faced by middle-aged and elderly populations in southern Ukraine following the Kakhovka Dam disaster, and how are these challenges being addressed?
**Answer:** The primary healthcare challenges faced by middle-aged and elderly populations in southern Ukraine following the Kakhovka Dam disaster include a lack of access to quality medicine[11][17], and a change in their mental state, specifically anxiety and sleep disturbances[11][17]. Many of these individuals also suffer from chronic diseases[11]. The overall healthcare system in southern Ukraine has been significantly impacted[11], with healthcare becoming harder to access[11]. Healthcare workers in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions operate amid poor conditions, including destroyed hospitals, a lack of medical staff, and daily shelling[12][19].

These challenges are being addressed through various efforts:
*   Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams have provided medical and humanitarian aid[14], including operating mobile clinics in areas like the Kherson oblast region[12].
*   The UN response was swift and continues[15].
*   Locally, a Ministry of Health nurse, Olha Varenyk, initially conducted medical check-ups in her home in the village of Virivka, Kherson, and later a modular structure was installed in her yard to allow her to see patients[12][19].

**Question:**  How is Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) addressing the healthcare needs of communities in the Kherson oblast region, particularly in light of the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam and the ongoing conflict?
**Answer:** Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams provided medical and humanitarian aid to people affected after the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine's Kherson region was destroyed on June 6, 2023[22]. One year after the disaster, MSF continues to provide support[21]. The MSF mobile clinic team operates in the Kherson oblast region in southeastern Ukraine, seeing patients[21]. Communities are coping with consequences such as mental health effects, including anxiety and sleep disturbances[22][30]. The work is conducted amidst reminders of the ongoing war, including destroyed buildings and "Beware of mines" signs[22].

**Question:**  How are local healthcare workers, such as those in the village of Virivka, adapting to the challenges posed by destroyed medical facilities and ongoing military conflict?
**Answer:** In the village of Virivka in Kherson, where the medical facility was destroyed and looted during Russian military occupation[31][32], Ministry of Health nurse Olha Varenyk initially conducted medical check-ups in her home[31][32]. Recently, a modular structure was installed in her yard, allowing her to see patients there[31][32]. Healthcare workers in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions generally operate amid poor conditions, including destroyed hospitals, a lack of medical staff, and daily shelling[31][32].

### Urgent Restoration Needed for Rafah Hospitals Amidst Flooding and Health Crisis

**Question:**  What are the specific challenges faced by the partially functional field hospital in providing medical services due to hostilities in the area, and what steps can be taken to improve access and functionality?
**Answer:** The partially functional field hospital faces challenges including being inaccessible due to hostilities in its vicinity[1]. As a result, it can only provide basic services to patients inside[1]. To improve access and functionality, the World Health Organization (WHO) states that hospitals in Rafah urgently need to be restored[1].

**Question:**  How does the emotional impact of past flooding events, such as the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, affect the mental health of residents in the affected areas, and what support is available to them?
**Answer:** The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station and the subsequent flooding have an emotional impact on residents, causing distress such as crying when remembering the event[11][12]. Olha Panich, for example, cried when recalling how the lower street, riverbank, houses, and gardens were flooded, forcing people to move to higher ground[11][13].

Regarding support, MSF (Doctors Without Borders) mobile clinics provide medical services and medicines to residents in affected areas, including Kherson and Mykolaiv regions[20]. These clinics are staffed by doctors, paramedics, nurses, social workers, and psychologists[15].

**Question:**  What are the health needs of the elderly population in the Mykolaiv region, as observed by MSF mobile clinics, and how are these needs being prioritized in the humanitarian response?
**Answer:** Most residents lined up for consultations at Doctors Without Borders (MSF) mobile clinics in Novosofiyivka, Mykolaiv region, are elderly women[21][24][30]. Their observed health needs include cardiovascular diseases, for which MSF health promoters provide education on avoidance[28]. MSF doctors also check blood pressure and blood sugar levels and prescribe necessary medicines[28].

In the humanitarian response, MSF mobile clinics provide medical services and medicines to residents in the Mykolaiv region[23][24], conducting consultations at local medical units[22]. To ensure continued access, MSF teams found a single bridge that had not been flooded, allowing them to continue seeing patients on the other side of the river[21][22]. Necessary supplies were also sent by boat from the village of Fedorivka, located across the river[21][22]. On the inaccessible side of the river, MSF was the sole organization offering medical services and medicines at that time[23][29]. Additionally, MSF distributed water, water disinfectants, and medicine kits[29].

**Question:**  What strategies can be implemented to address the shortage of drinking water in the flooded areas of Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, considering the flooding of wells and boreholes?
**Answer:** To address the shortage of drinking water in the flooded areas of Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, where wells and boreholes were flooded[31][34], Doctors Without Borders (MSF) purchased large quantities of water and storage containers and began distributing them to residents[34][38]. They also brought packs with water and water disinfectants[38], which residents transported to the other side by boat[35].

**Question:**  How is the shortage of drinking water being addressed in the communities along the Inhulets River, and what role do volunteers play in the distribution of water and medical supplies?
**Answer:** A shortage of drinking water occurred in communities along the Inhulets River because all wells and boreholes were flooded[43][44]. To address this, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) purchased large quantities of water and storage containers and began distributing them to residents[41][43]. Reaching the opposite bank of the Inhulets was challenging[42], so MSF teams sought the support of volunteers[42]. Volunteers helped transport packs with water, water disinfectants, and medicine kits to the other side by boat[41][42].

**Question:**  How is the shortage of medical supplies and personnel affecting the health outcomes of residents in flood-affected areas, and what additional resources are needed to address these gaps?
**Answer:** On the inaccessible side of the river, Doctors Without Borders was the "sole organization offering medical services and medicines" at that time[51][55]. This shortage affected health outcomes, as exemplified by a patient whose blood sugar was "extremely high and rapidly increasing," and "neither the paramedic nor any of the neighbours had any medicines that could help"[54][56].

To address these gaps, Doctors Without Borders purchased large quantities of water and storage containers and began distributing them to residents[51][55]. They sent necessary supplies, including medicine, by boat from the village of Fedorivka, located across the river[52][54]. They also sought the support of volunteers to transport packs with water, water disinfectants, and medicine kits to the other side by boat[55][56]. Additionally, the Doctors Without Borders team found a single unflooded bridge, which allowed them to continue seeing patients on the other side of the river[52][54]. Doctors Without Borders continues to operate mobile clinics staffed by doctors, paramedics, nurses, social workers, and psychologists, providing medical services and medicines to residents[51][60], transporting patients to hospitals in ambulances, and supporting frontline hospitals with medical donations[60].

The provided sources do not specify what *additional* resources are needed to address these gaps beyond what Doctors Without Borders has already provided or is currently providing.

### Insufficient Collective Centers and UXO Threats Challenge Sumy and Mykolaiv Regions

**Question:** What measures are being taken to increase the capacity of Collective Centers (CCs) in Sumy to accommodate the growing number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) from the 20-30 km high-risk zones?
**Answer:** The provided sources do not contain information relevant to this query.[1]states that there are only 11 Collective Centers (CCs) in Sumy, which is insufficient for potential internally displaced persons (IDPs)[1]. Local authorities are concerned about the growing number of IDPs if the security situation deteriorates within a 20-30 km zone[1].

### Coordinated Health Efforts and Agricultural Challenges Amidst Kharkiv Displacement Crisis

**Question:** How are Health Cluster partners, such as the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Stellar Ukraine, coordinating efforts to provide health consultations to displaced people at the Kharkiv City Transit Center?
**Answer:** Health Cluster partners, including the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Stellar Ukraine mobile teams, are coordinating efforts by receiving displaced people for health consultations at the Kharkiv City Transit Center[1].

**Question:** How is the FAO prioritizing resource allocation among the various agricultural sectors, particularly those less attended to, such as fruit, vegetable, dairy, poultry, and honey sectors?
**Answer:** Less attention is paid to the fruit and vegetable, dairy, poultry, and honey sectors[11]. The provided sources do not contain information on how the FAO is prioritizing resource allocation among these various agricultural sectors.

**Question:** What measures can be taken to address the underfunding and lack of attention to the fruit and vegetable, dairy, poultry, and honey sectors in Ukraine's rural areas?
**Answer:** Less attention is paid to the fruit and vegetable, dairy, poultry, and honey sectors[21]. To address challenges like labor shortages curtailing production in these sectors, investments to adapt agricultural equipment for use by persons with disabilities (PWDs) could mitigate these shortages and lower unemployment among PWDs[21].

**Question:** What measures are being taken to address labor shortages in Ukraine's agricultural sector, and how can investments in equipment for persons with disabilities (PWDs) mitigate these shortages?
**Answer:** Labor shortages are a significant factor curtailing production in Ukraine's agricultural sector[31]. Investments to adapt agricultural equipment for use by persons with disabilities (PWDs) could mitigate these shortages and lower unemployment among PWDs[31].

**Question:** How is the destruction of infrastructure impacting agricultural production, and what are the proposed solutions to overcome these challenges?
**Answer:** The destruction of infrastructure is a challenging factor for production in the wake of war[41]. The provided sources do not clearly state proposed solutions specifically to overcome challenges arising from the destruction of infrastructure impacting agricultural production.

### Ukraine's Reconstruction: Advancing Gender Equality and Climate-Resilient Economic Transformation

**Question:** What specific strategies are being implemented to integrate sustainability into Ukraine's reconstruction efforts, considering the estimated cost of over USD 486 billion?
**Answer:** Ukraine aims to capitalize upon its reconstruction, which is estimated to cost over USD 486 billion[1], to transform its economy and society to become climate resilient and inclusive[1]. The country can meaningfully contribute to Europe's economic growth and strategic autonomy through innovation, energy security, decarbonization, and diversified supply chains[3].

**Question:** How are organizations like CARE and JurFem advocating for gender equality and the rights of gender-based violence survivors in the context of Ukraine's recovery efforts?
**Answer:** Organizations like CARE and JurFem are advocating for gender equality and the rights of gender-based violence survivors in Ukraine's recovery efforts by calling for the participation of Ukrainian women and the promotion of gender equality in all reconstruction and recovery processes[11]. CARE emphasizes that the meaningful and direct participation of women, girls, and marginalized groups in decision-making is key to forming an equitable, inclusive, gender-responsive, and effective recovery agenda[14]. They also advocate for protecting and ensuring equitable access to services and opportunities for women to rebuild their lives[14].

CARE welcomes the broader participation of Ukrainian civil society, including women's rights and women-led organizations, at the Ukraine Recovery Conference 2024, as well as the intention to integrate gender perspectives throughout the conference[13]. They are present at the conference to ensure that economic support and inclusion in social programs for survivors are considered in discussions, decisions, and interventions[13].

JurFem, a partner organization of CARE, works to develop gender-oriented approaches in government and business, with a focus on combating violence against women[12]. Its Chairwoman, Khrystyna Kit, states that a just recovery is not possible without a gender component[12]. JurFem highlights that a key question is how to strengthen the rights of gender-based violence survivors in recovery, noting that psychological and medical support alone are not sufficient[12].

**Question:** What measures are being taken to support Ukrainian women's rights and women-led organizations in driving efforts to meet the needs of vulnerable groups and survivors of gender-based violence?
**Answer:** Ukrainian women's rights and women-led organizations are being supported through their broader participation at the Ukraine Recovery Conference 2024[22]. This includes organizations like the women lawyers association JurFem, a CARE partner, participating in the recovery conference[24]. This support aims to enable them to have a stronger voice in decision-making on reconstruction and recovery[24]. Additionally, there is an intention to integrate gender perspectives throughout the Ukraine Recovery Conference 2024[22].

### Geographical Contexts Dictate Emergency Response Priorities and Challenges in Crisis Zones

**Question:**  How does the document define the geographical contexts that influence the prioritization and implementation of Shelter Cluster activities, and what are the specific challenges associated with each context?
**Answer:** The document defines geographical contexts as factors that affect the prioritization of activities chosen for a location, such as limited access, proximity to conflict zones, or onset emergencies following attacks[1]. The nature of the crisis is geographically specific, and four different zones have been established to frame expected interventions[7].

The specific geographical contexts and their associated challenges are:
*   **Context 1:** Refers to areas that are regularly attacked and, therefore, require emergency activities[7].
*   **Context 4:** Refers to areas not under government control, where humanitarian access is extremely limited, needs assessment capacity is very low, markets are non-functional, and last-mile distribution poses a challenge[2].

The provided sources do not contain specific definitions or challenges for Context 2 or Context 3.

**Question:**  What are the specific indicators used to monitor and report the effectiveness of emergency construction materials and shelter kits (ECM and ESK) distribution in Ukraine?
**Answer:** The specific indicators used to monitor and report the effectiveness of emergency construction materials and shelter kits (ECM and ESK) distribution are: the number of households supported with emergency shelter assistance, the number of individuals supported with emergency shelter assistance, the number of social facilities supported with emergency shelter assistance, and the number of residential units supported with emergency shelter assistance[12].

### Enhancing URCS Capabilities in Cash and Voucher Assistance Through CashCap Integration

**Question:**  How did the embedding of CashCap experts within the Ukraine Red Cross Society (URCS) enhance their role and visibility in external coordination forums, such as the Cash Working Groups (CWGs)?
**Answer:** The embedding of CashCap experts effectively positioned the Ukraine Red Cross Society (URCS) in external coordination forums, notably Cash Working Groups (CWGs)[2]. In Ukraine, URCS attained co-chair status in the CWG[1], which was facilitated by the expert's leadership and training efforts[1]. This led to URCS taking on a more significant role in external coordination structures[4]. Being co-chair provided URCS with visibility among donors and international organizations[4], and combined with their role as a large cash actor, it granted them Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) legitimacy[4].

**Question:**  What role did the CashCap experts play in facilitating the Ukraine Red Cross Society's (URCS) partnerships with the government and other stakeholders, and what were the outcomes of these partnerships?
**Answer:** CashCap experts were embedded within the Ukraine Red Cross Society (URCS)[11]and played a crucial role in facilitating its partnerships and coordination with the government and other stakeholders. Their role involved providing expertise in coordination, facilitating multistakeholder collaboration processes, capacity-strengthening, policy influence, and advocacy for quality Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA)[12]. Experts also enhanced CVA skills and competence within URCS[11], contributed to documentation development and information management enhancements[18], and helped URCS gain a deeper understanding of its role with the government[13].

As a result of this facilitation:
*   URCS was positioned effectively in external coordination forums, notably Cash Working Groups (CWG)[20].
*   URCS attained co-chair status in the CWG, facilitated by the expert's leadership and training efforts[14]. This co-chair status provided URCS with visibility among donors and international organizations, and CVA legitimacy as a significant cash actor[13].
*   URCS took on more significant roles in external coordination structures[13].
*   URCS became the sole partner of the government (Ministry of Reintegration and Occupied Policy) since September 2022, handling registration, payment, Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM), and Community Engagement and Accountability (CEA)[15].
*   Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) were established with the government[20].
*   URCS implemented a no-regret cash in envelope for 270,000 recipients for the Ministry of Reintegration and Occupied Policy[15][20].
*   URCS also handled 100,000 recipients per month for host community members hosting Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)[15].
*   The experts' work contributed to the visibility and empowerment of URCS[13].

**Question:**  What were the perceived gaps in understanding and implementation of Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) within the Ukraine Red Cross Society (URCS), and what strategies were recommended to address these gaps?
**Answer:** Within the Ukraine Red Cross Society (URCS), perceived gaps included the National Society not being fully cash ready, a gap in understanding at the branch level, and the absence of sectoral cash for URCS[21].

To address these gaps, interviewees, especially in National Societies, advocated for structured deployment with clearer objectives and increased involvement in expert selection[30]. In Ukraine, there was a proposal to involve the National Society (NS) and CashCap directly in decision-making and Terms of Reference (ToRs) drafting, along with regular partner check-ins[30]. Additionally, about half of interviewees suggested a more structured approach for future deployments, with some NS interviewees emphasizing the importance of interpersonal skills and seeking involvement in setting objectives and expert selection[30].

**Question:**  What were the key challenges faced by the Ukraine Red Cross Society (URCS) in achieving full cash readiness, and how did CashCap experts address these challenges?
**Answer:** Some interviewees felt the Ukraine Red Cross Society (URCS) was not fully cash ready, citing a gap in understanding at the branch level and the absence of sectoral cash for URCS[34].

CashCap experts addressed these challenges by significantly enhancing Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) skills and competence in Ukraine, leading to substantial improvements[33]. Their contributions included documentation development and information management enhancements[34]. Skill enhancement was achieved through daily teaching and mentoring, collective capacity-building activities, and quality feedback and reporting[31]. In Ukraine, the expert's leadership and training efforts also facilitated URCS attaining co-chair status in the Cash Working Group (CWG)[39]. Experts' knowledge of cash coordination and extensive experience in CVA were crucial[33].

### HeRAMS Identifies Critical Health Resource Gaps in Conflict-Affected Ukraine

**Question:**  How does the ongoing conflict in Ukraine impact the availability and functionality of public health facilities as monitored by HeRAMS?
**Answer:** The Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS) monitors the availability of critical health resources and services in Ukraine[11][12]. It aims to identify existing gaps and establish intervention priorities[18]. HeRAMS provides a summary of the status of health facilities within Ukraine, focusing on the availability of essential services and the challenges impeding access to these services[11]. Data is consistently collected and updated for all accessible public health facilities[18]. The ongoing conflict has resulted in attacks damaging health facilities since February 24, 2022[11].

**Question:** How is the UN documenting and responding to the violations against Ukrainian children, and what support is being provided to affected families?
**Answer:** The UN consistently documents violations against Ukrainian children[21]. The Secretary-General officially listed Russia for the killing and maiming of Ukrainian children in 2023[21]. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collects information on civilian harm from conflict-related violence using a wide range of sources, such as interviews with victims, their relatives, and witnesses; open-source information; forensic records; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organizations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; and data from medical facilities and local authorities[23]. All sources and information are assessed for relevance and credibility and cross-checked[23].

The UN has been able to verify cases of harm[22], but notes that the actual extent of civilian harm, including casualties and infrastructure damage, is likely considerably higher[25]. This is due to the large number of reports and the lack of access to relevant areas, particularly from the period immediately after the full-scale armed attack[22]. Requests by the UN to access Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation are consistently denied[22]. More than 600 Ukrainian children have been killed and 1,420 injured since the escalation of Russia's invasion in February 2022[27]. Children in frontline regions have spent the equivalent of seven months underground in bomb shelters because of relentless attacks[24].

In response, the UN works with the Government to provide the care these children so desperately need[21]. Since the beginning of the war, over 117,000 people, including refugees, internally displaced persons, and host communities, have benefited from mental health and psychosocial support services in Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, and Georgia[25].

**Question:**  What specific types of health facilities are included in the HeRAMS data verification process, and how are they selected?
**Answer:** The sample for the HeRAMS data verification process is stratified according to the type of health facility[35]. This includes both Multi-Profile Health Facilities (MPHFs) and Primary Health Centers (PHCs)[32]. The healthcare facilities are selected randomly for the verification process[31].

### Targeted Interventions and Psychosocial Support Efforts in Ukraine's Conflict Zones

**Question:** How can the Multi-sector Needs Assessment (MSNA) data be used to develop targeted interventions that address the specific needs of different demographic groups in Ukraine, considering the intersectionality of gender and other vulnerabilities?
**Answer:** The Multi-sector Needs Assessment (MSNA) data highlights the multifaceted challenges faced by various demographic groups in Ukraine, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions addressing these diverse challenges[1]. The findings demonstrate that the intersection of head of household gender with other vulnerabilities appears to aggravate households' level of need[1]. This assessment covers gender, disability, inclusion, displacement, and humanitarian needs[2]. The data can be used to prioritize assistance based on specific household and individual characteristics, such as female-headed households, disabled person-headed households, vulnerable older people, persons with disabilities, and children without caretaker or family support[1].

**Question:** How are the skills acquired by faith and youth leaders during the Psychological First Aid training in Lviv being applied in their communities to support individuals affected by the conflict in Ukraine?
**Answer:** Upon returning to their communities, faith leaders, youth leaders, and volunteers who underwent Psychological First Aid training in Lviv will apply the learned psychological interventions to train and support those most affected by the war[21]. This aims to foster resilience and mental well-being at the grassroots level[21].

**Question:** What measures can be taken to ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of the Psychological First Aid training provided to faith and youth leaders in Lviv, Ukraine?
**Answer:** The sustainability and effectiveness of the Psychological First Aid training provided to faith and youth leaders in Lviv, Ukraine, are ensured by these leaders applying the learned psychological interventions upon returning to their communities[31]. They will use these interventions to train and support those most affected by the war[31], fostering resilience and mental well-being at the grassroots level[31].

### Strategic Measures for Safety and Security in Donetska Oblast Operations

**Question:** What strategies are in place to ensure the safety and security of evacuees and humanitarian workers in the Donetska oblast, considering the recommendation to switch to online formats due to security risks?
**Answer:** To ensure the safety and security of evacuees and humanitarian workers in Donetska oblast, several strategies are in place:
*   Partners working or planning to work in Donetska oblast are recommended to switch to an online format or use mobile brigades in areas where offline activities could put beneficiaries at risk[1].
*   All activities must be held only in safe places and if the security situation allows[1].
*   Regular consultations with authorities should be conducted regarding the security situation in other areas[1].
*   Heads of military administrations have been tasked with pre-determining evacuation routes and the availability of transit hubs[1].
*   Online educational and wellbeing support is provided to affected children in locations like Dobropillia, Druzhkivka, and Kramatorsk, especially where the security situation prevents offline learning services[1].

**Question:** What specific technical support and assistance has the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) provided to Ukraine to re-establish a sound nuclear safety and security regime at its nuclear facilities?
**Answer:** The provided sources state that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is responding to Ukraine's requests to provide technical support and assistance in re-establishing, as appropriate, a sound nuclear safety and security regime at its nuclear facilities and in activities involving radioactive sources[11].
