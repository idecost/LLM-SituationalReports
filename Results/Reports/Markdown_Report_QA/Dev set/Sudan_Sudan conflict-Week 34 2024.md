# Sudan conflict-Week 34 2024 

## Summary 
Sudan is currently facing a severe humanitarian crisis marked by an ongoing 16-month civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has resulted in over 10 million displaced people and at least 18,000 deaths[7]. As of July 2024, famine is ongoing in Zamzam camp near El Fasher, with the city itself under RSF siege, and many other areas across Sudan remain at risk of famine, affecting over 25 million people or about half the population[1][39]. The country is also battling widespread health emergencies, including a confirmed cholera outbreak in Kassala and other states as of July 2024, with 11,327 cases and 316 fatalities reported by WHO, and at least 12 of 18 states experiencing multiple simultaneous outbreaks[39]. Humanitarian aid delivery is significantly hampered by heavy rains and floods, which have affected nearly 143,000 people, displaced at least 27,000, and left over 50 World Food Programme (WFP) trucks carrying aid for 500,000 people stranded due to impassable roads[40]. Despite these challenges, the Adre border crossing from Chad into Darfur, previously closed for six months, was reopened in August 2024, allowing WFP and International Organization for Migration (IOM) aid convoys to deliver supplies for tens of thousands, with WFP having additional supplies for 500,000 people ready to move through this critical route[19][30][31][43][45]. Meanwhile, Sudan's military-controlled sovereign council is engaging in diplomatic efforts, sending a delegation to Cairo for discussions with American officials regarding peace talks[8].

## Questions and Answers

### Sudan Conflict: Humanitarian Crisis Escalates Amid Aid Delivery Challenges

**Question:**  What are the implications of the destruction and damage to over 16,000 homes in Sudan, and how is this affecting the displaced populations?
**Answer:** Over 6,000 homes have been completely destroyed, with over 10,000 damaged[2]. The implications for displaced populations include that roughly half of the nearly eight million Sudanese internally displaced by the conflict are being accommodated by friends, family, or strangers[3]. Additionally, hundreds of thousands of displaced people have lost their livelihoods and access to farmland, leading to hunger and critical food shortages[10]. Many displaced people are also waiting to travel to their final destinations due to a lack of resources[3].

**Question:**  What role are local and national humanitarian organizations playing in addressing the needs of displaced populations in Sudan, and what challenges do they face?
**Answer:** Local and national humanitarian organizations in Sudan play a significant role in addressing the needs of displaced populations[15][18]. Emergency rooms, charitable organizations, and local committees are actively providing daily meals and medical care to those affected by the conflict[12]. Communal kitchens have also stepped up to offer meals and emotional support to hundreds of thousands in Khartoum[15]. Approximately 150 humanitarian organizations across Sudan, including national NGOs, have reached nearly 8 million people with some form of humanitarian aid since January[15]. Additionally, roughly half of the nearly eight million Sudanese internally displaced by the conflict are being accommodated by friends, family, or strangers, highlighting the role of local communities in hosting[11].

However, these organizations face numerous challenges. They encounter obstacles imposed by warring parties, including administrative and bureaucratic hurdles[12]. Humanitarian workers and volunteers face threats such as arrests, prolonged investigations, restrictions on movement, systematic targeting, and confiscation of aid[12]. At least 22 Sudanese national aid workers have been killed while on duty, and at least 34 have been wounded or injured[15]. Female aid workers are at high risk of sexual violence, which has been weaponized by warring factions[12]. The lack of safety and security is a major concern, with international humanitarian law not being respected, leading to potential attacks at any time or place without warning[17]. Restrictions on civil society organizations and grassroots committees have severely hampered their ability to gather information, assess situations, and call for assistance[12]. Communication blackouts further limit capabilities and hinder access to funding via banking applications[12]. Furthermore, the Sudan humanitarian appeal, seeking US$2.7 billion, is only 33 percent funded, constraining and limiting the response efforts of national NGOs[15]. Obstruction of aid delivery by militias is also a problem[15]. Main supply routes can be inaccessible, preventing the delivery of necessities like food and medical supplies[17]. The rainy season also complicates access due to heavy rains and flash floods[17].

**Question:**  How is the initiative's roadmap being received by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF), and what are the next steps for formal talks?
**Answer:** The initiative's roadmap, which contains 10 key points, was presented to the leadership of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) 22nd Infantry Division in Babanusa and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) leadership in West Kordofan, based in Al-Fulah[31]. The Commander of the 22nd Infantry Division, Hassan Darmot, and the RSF advisor in the region expressed strong support for the initiative[31]. The military parties have given a positive response and expressed goodwill[31].

While formal talks have not yet occurred, the next steps involve working on setting official meeting dates between the initiative's delegation and the leadership of the SAF 22nd Infantry Division and RSF[31]. No formal results or agreements have been achieved yet[31].

### Cholera Outbreak in Sudan: Urgent Response and Vaccine Shortage Challenges

**Question:**  What measures has the World Health Organization (WHO) taken in response to the cholera outbreak in Sudan, and how are they addressing the increase in dengue and meningitis cases?
**Answer:** The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 11,327 cases of cholera in Sudan, with 316 fatalities[1]. WHO is cooperating with state health ministries as part of an extensive campaign to tackle the cholera epidemic[5]. Additionally, WHO has summarized the multi-country health situation and its response to the regional emergency caused by the conflict in Sudan[4]. WHO has warned of an increase in dengue and meningitis cases due to the civil war[1].

**Question:**  What measures has the Sudanese Ministry of Health implemented to address the cholera outbreak attributed to poor environmental conditions and contaminated drinking water?
**Answer:** The Sudanese Ministry of Health has implemented several measures to address the cholera outbreak, which was attributed to poor environmental conditions and contaminated drinking water[11]. The Federal Health Ministry launched a cholera vaccination campaign that targeted 51,000 people in Wad El Helew[13]. Additionally, Dr. Haitham Mohammed Ibrahim, a leading official, announced an extensive campaign to tackle the cholera epidemic, which includes cooperation with state health ministries, the World Health Organisation (WHO), and UNICEF[14].

**Question:**  How is the Federal Emergency Operations Centre coordinating with state health ministries, the World Health Organization (WHO), and UNICEF to tackle the cholera epidemic in Sudan?
**Answer:** The Federal Emergency Operations Centre is tackling the cholera epidemic through an extensive campaign[21]. This campaign includes cooperation with state health ministries, the World Health Organisation (WHO), and UNICEF[21].

**Question:**  What specific areas in Sudan are most affected by the cholera outbreak, and what is the current status of vaccination campaigns in these areas?
**Answer:** The cholera outbreak in Sudan is predominantly in eastern Sudan's Kassala[32], with an officially declared outbreak ongoing in Kassala and several other states[33]. The most affected areas within Kassala include Wad El Helew with 176 cases, Kassala city with 126 cases, and Khashm El Girba with 81 cases[31].

To combat the outbreak, a cholera vaccination campaign was launched in Wad El Helew, targeting 51,000 people[31]. An extensive campaign to tackle the cholera epidemic was announced[40]. However, vaccines quickly ran out due to the high number of displaced individuals, and health officials have called for additional supplies to meet the demand[40].

### RSF Supports Adre Border Opening to Enhance Humanitarian Aid in Darfur

**Question:**  What measures are being taken by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations in South Darfur following the reopening of the Adre border crossing?
**Answer:** The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) Civil Administration in South Darfur State has welcomed the opening of the Adre border crossing[1]. The head of the state's civil administration, Mohamed Ahmed Hassan, announced RSF's readiness to establish strong partnerships and facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations that come to provide services and assistance to the residents[1].

**Question:**  What are the reported consequences of the civil war in Sudan on the humanitarian situation, particularly in terms of food insecurity and displacement?
**Answer:** The civil war in Sudan, which has been raging for approximately 16 months[13], has led to severe humanitarian consequences[16]. The conflict has caused a huge hunger crisis[19], with more than six million people facing food insecurity across Darfur, and over 25 million, or about half the population, in a similar situation across the country[11][14]. More than a dozen areas in Sudan are either experiencing or are at risk of famine[12][19]. The World Food Programme (WFP) and other aid organizations have warned of an imminent famine[13], which is blamed on the civil war, displacement, and humanitarian access constraints[12]. Reports indicate that deaths have already occurred, particularly among infants and young children suffering from acute malnutrition[16].

In terms of displacement, the conflict has triggered the largest refugee crisis globally, with over ten million people displaced or forced to flee, many of them multiple times[13]. The power struggle has also resulted in nearly 15,000 deaths[13].

### WFP Implements Alternative Routes to Overcome Sudan's Logistical Challenges

**Question:**  What strategies is the World Food Programme (WFP) implementing to sustain the flow of food and nutrition assistance into Sudan amid the ongoing conflict and flooding?
**Answer:** To sustain the flow of food and nutrition assistance into Sudan, the World Food Programme (WFP) is implementing several strategies:

*   WFP is using alternative and longer routes, such as through Chad's Tine crossing into North Darfur[1][2][3][5], and long, dangerous routes from Port Sudan that cross battle frontlines and areas controlled by different militia groups to reach communities in Darfur[1][2][5]. A newly re-opened route is also being utilized for swift movement of supplies[3].
*   WFP is scaling up food assistance, aiming to support up to 8.4 million people by the end of the year in 14 areas either in famine or at risk of famine, largely located in Darfur, Kordofan, Khartoum, and Gezira[1][2][3][5][6].
*   In Khartoum, where truck access is difficult, WFP has started using alternative ways of delivering assistance, including mobile money, cash vouchers, and support for community kitchens to provide hot meals[7].
*   UN humanitarians continue to engage with Sudanese authorities to facilitate additional trucks for a constant supply of humanitarian goods[6].

**Question:**  How are floods impacting the delivery of humanitarian aid in Sudan, and what measures are being taken to address these challenges?
**Answer:** Floods are impacting the delivery of humanitarian aid in Sudan by frustrating the flow of aid[17]. More than 50 trucks carrying an estimated 4,800 metric tons of World Food Programme (WFP) food and nutrition assistance are stuck in various locations across Sudan, unable to move towards their final destinations due to flooded and impassable roads[11]. The rainy season exacerbates the already devastating situation, as floods force more people from their homes, increase humanitarian needs, and cut off communities from vital assistance[11]. Heavy rains have destroyed key bridges and made it extremely difficult for aid convoys to pass through muddy, flooded roads[11]. Nearly 143,000 people in 12 of Sudan's 18 states have been affected by the floods, with 50 people killed and at least 27,000 people displaced[11]. Waterborne diseases such as typhoid and cholera also pose a threat to malnourished children and women[11]. Some forecasts warn that flooding could surpass the historic 2020 floods that hit Khartoum[11].

The provided sources do not clearly state specific measures being taken to address the challenges posed by these floods.

**Question:**  What alternative methods is WFP using to deliver food assistance in Khartoum, and what are the reasons for these alternatives?
**Answer:** In Khartoum, the World Food Programme (WFP) has begun using alternative methods to deliver assistance, including mobile money, cash vouchers, and support for community kitchens to provide hot meals[21]. These alternatives are being used because it is difficult for WFP food aid trucks to safely reach the capital[21].

**Question:**  How has the closure and subsequent reopening of the Adre route affected WFP's ability to deliver aid to North Darfur?
**Answer:** The Adre route was closed in February[31]. This closure forced the World Food Programme (WFP) to use a longer route into North Darfur through the Tine crossing in Chad[31]. Despite the closure, WFP was able to send two convoys through Adre in March and April[31]. With a newly re-opened route, WFP has food and nutrition supplies for around 500,000 people ready to move swiftly[38].

### Sudan Conflict Escalates: Civilian Casualties and Humanitarian Crisis Intensify

**Question:**  How are the airstrikes by the Sudanese army in North Darfur, particularly in areas like Abu Hamira and Al-Koma, impacting civilian populations and infrastructure?
**Answer:** Sudanese army airstrikes in North Darfur have resulted in civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure and livestock[1].

In Al-Koma, a town 75 km from El Fasher, a woman and her four children were killed by airstrikes[2]. They had been admitted to Al-Koma Rural Hospital with injuries but passed away due to a lack of necessary equipment at the hospital[2]. Warplanes also bombed sheep pastures on the outskirts of Al-Koma, killing over 150 livestock[2]. Eyewitnesses reported that only civilian areas were hit, with no Rapid Support Forces (RSF) gathering points affected[2].

In the Abu Hamira area of Umm Kadada, 168 km east of El Fasher, Sudanese army warplanes launched airstrikes[1]. Two Sukhoi planes fired two shells near a water station in the Telis area[1]. Additionally, army warplanes launched air raids on Al-Tawisha in North Darfur, killing and wounding dozens of civilians[2].

**Question:**  What challenges are faced by humanitarian organizations in delivering aid to famine-stricken areas in Sudan, and how has the reopening of the Adre border crossing influenced these efforts?
**Answer:** Humanitarian organizations face several challenges in delivering aid to famine-stricken areas in Sudan. These include delays in humanitarian access[17], perilous routes that cross battle frontlines and areas controlled by different armed groups[13], and obstruction by warring parties who impede aid convoys, confiscate, or divert supplies[17]. Additionally, severe autumn rainy seasons have disrupted major roads, destroyed bridges, and hindered the delivery of crucial humanitarian assistance[17]. There is also a "shrinking space" for humanitarian action[14].

The reopening of the Adre border crossing has significantly influenced these efforts. The crossing was reopened by Sudanese authorities after a six-month closure[11][12][14][15]. It was announced on August 15 that the Adr border crossing would be opened for the first inter-agency cross-border transport of vital humanitarian aid through this corridor since February[15]. The first World Food Programme (WFP) food supplies for communities in Darfur crossed the Adre border from Chad[18][19]. WFP trucks, carrying sorghum, pulses, oil, and rice for 13,000 people in Kereneik, West Darfur, crossed on Tuesday evening[11][12]. UNHCR also had four trucks of Core Relief Items as part of the first inter-agency convoy on August 21[15].

The reopening of the Adre crossing is considered critical for preventing famine from spreading across Sudan[11][12]. The UN Secretary-General commended the Sudanese authorities on August 17 for reopening the Adr border crossing, recognizing it as a direct route for humanitarian aid[15]. This move aims to facilitate humanitarian aid for civilians displaced by Darfur's violence[13]. WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain emphasized that the reopening is vital for getting lifesaving aid to millions and stressed the need for all border crossings to be open daily to avoid widespread starvation[11][12][15][18][19]. The Adr border crossing was announced to be open for a three-month period[13].

**Question:**  How are the ongoing conflicts and airstrikes impacting the availability and functionality of health facilities in Sudan, particularly in conflict-affected areas?
**Answer:** The 16-month long conflict has had a devastating impact on civilian infrastructure, rendering over 75% of health facilities in conflict-affected states non-functional[21][22]. Since April 2023, 88 attacks on health care, including on health facilities, ambulances, transport, assets, patients, and health workers, have been verified, resulting in 55 deaths and 104 injuries[21][22]. The destruction of power, water, and sanitation infrastructure in conflict areas has also increased the risk of diseases and contributed to famine risk[21][22].

Specific instances of airstrikes impacting health facilities include:
*   A major hospital in El Daein was bombed out of service, killing at least 15 people[23].
*   A Sudanese army warplane launched an airstrike on a vaccination center west of El Daein Teaching Hospital[25].
*   Sudanese army aircraft hit El Daein Teaching Hospital, killing 18 civilians, including six hospital employees, and injuring approximately 20 others[25].
*   Patients and medics evacuated El Daein Teaching Hospital after it was bombed by Sudanese army military aircraft[25].
*   In Al-Koma, a clinic lacked necessary equipment, contributing to the deaths of a woman and her four children who had been admitted with injuries after airstrikes[25].

**Question:**  How is the ongoing siege by the RSF affecting the humanitarian situation in El Fasher, particularly in terms of food security and access to basic services?
**Answer:** The ongoing siege by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in El Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur State, has led to critical living conditions[31]. Famine is looming in the city[31], and famine conditions were confirmed in Zamzam displacement camp near Al Fasher[32], where people were reported to be starving to death[31]. The city has been under RSF siege since last May[31], and the five-month blockade has made living conditions critical[31].

In terms of basic services, access to safe water is an enormous challenge in Zamzam camp[36]. All wells at the camp were out of service due to a lack of fuel because the area is surrounded by the RSF[36]. Only two of the eight water wells in the camp are currently operating[36], and there is a struggle to bring water to the camp due to clashes, artillery shelling, and lack of funding[36].
