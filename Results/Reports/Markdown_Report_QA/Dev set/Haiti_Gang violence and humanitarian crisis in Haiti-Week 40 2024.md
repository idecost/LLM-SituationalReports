# Gang violence and humanitarian crisis in Haiti-Week 40 2024 

## Summary 
Haiti is currently facing a worsening humanitarian crisis driven by alarming rates of armed gang violence, which has severely disrupted daily life, forced mass displacement, and exacerbated acute food insecurity[63][139][142]. Armed gangs control nearly 80% of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince and are expanding into rural regions, terrorizing residents with killings, rapes, and kidnappings, while also impeding the movement of people and goods[3]. A recent attack on October 3, 2024, in the Pont Sond area of the Artibonite department, resulted in at least 70 deaths and 357 injuries, displacing an estimated 6,270 people[135][136][138]. Over 700,000 people are internally displaced across the country, a 22% increase since June, with many lacking essential food, water, shelter, and medical care[75]. Nearly half of Haiti's population, over 5 million people, is experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or worse) between August 2024 and February 2025, including 6,000 people facing catastrophic hunger (IPC Phase 5) and 2 million at emergency levels (IPC Phase 4)[124][139][142]. In response to the escalating violence, Prime Minister Garry Conille announced a joint operation with Kenyan police on August 29, 2024, to target criminal gangs in Port-au-Prince[129], and a UN-backed Kenyan mission, which began in late June, is working to quell violence but requires substantial additional personnel and resources[63]. The crisis also poses severe protection risks for children, with an average of five killed per week in the first half of 2024, and leaves women and girls highly vulnerable to gender-based violence[41].

The provided sources do not contain information detailing what specific support the United Nations Human Rights Office (OHCHR) is providing to local authorities.

### Haiti Faces Severe Food Insecurity Amid Displacement and Economic Instability

**Question:**  What are the primary factors contributing to the severe food insecurity experienced by families in Haiti, as described in the text?
**Answer:** The severe food insecurity experienced by families in Haiti is primarily due to several factors:

*   **Displacement and restricted access:** Families are forced to flee their homes after gangs raid their neighborhoods[5][6], which prevents them from accessing markets[2].
*   **Lack of stable employment and insufficient income:** Construction jobs are drying up[5], forcing individuals to seek alternative work like searching for wood to make charcoal[7]. Some families depend on remittances, but this money barely lasts a week[8], leading to an inability to provide food daily[5].
*   **Scarcity and infrequent availability of food:** Food does not come around very often[2], and it is very rare for individuals to get a meal a day[2][5]. The available food is often insufficient, with quantities meant for one person needing to feed ten[5].
*   **Competition for aid:** When organizations provide food, there is a major fight[7].
*   **Vulnerability leading to desperate measures:** In displacement camps, young girls are coerced into trading sex for food[6].

**Question:**  How has the drying up of construction jobs impacted the livelihoods of individuals like Yonel in Haiti, and what alternative means of income are they pursuing?
**Answer:** The drying up of construction jobs has impacted individuals like Yonel by forcing him, a former mason, to search for wood to make charcoal as an alternative means of income[11][12][14][15][16]. His wife also contributes by selling second-hand clothes[14]. This situation has made it difficult for Yonel to provide daily for his seven children[20], leading to days where the family eats only white rice or spaghetti[13]. Sometimes, Yonel and his wife take only a spoonful of food, leaving the rest for their children to prevent them from dying[12][16][17]. The food that would typically feed one person now has to feed ten, providing only enough nourishment to survive[15]. On days when they cannot afford a proper meal for their children, Yonel's wife mixes flour with spinach to prevent their stomachs from rumbling[14][16].

**Question:**  How does the lack of access to markets exacerbate the food insecurity situation for displaced individuals like Alexandra in Port-au-Prince?
**Answer:** The lack of access to markets exacerbates food insecurity for displaced individuals like Alexandra because they "couldn't go to the markets" and consequently "didn't have enough food to eat"[21]. Alexandra, who fled to the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, stated this directly[21].

**Question:**  How are families in Haiti coping with the scarcity of food, and what alternative means are they using to sustain themselves?
**Answer:** Families in Haiti are coping with food scarcity by eating very limited, basic foods, such as only white rice or spaghetti on some days `[32][33][34]`. Parents sometimes take only a spoonful of food themselves, leaving the rest for their children to prevent them from dying `[32][35]`. Food that would normally feed one person is stretched to feed ten, providing only enough nourishment to prevent death `[35]`. Some individuals rarely get a meal a day `[34]`. People also depend on others to feed their children `[34]`, and some take their 1-year-old children to clinics for a peanut butter mix to prevent their bodies from collapsing `[35]`.

For alternative means of sustenance, Jean Yonel, who was a mason, is now forced to search for wood to make charcoal because construction jobs have dried up `[35]`. In displacement camps, young girls as young as 15 are being coerced into trading sex for food `[36]`. Additionally, some individuals, like Judeline Auguste, depend solely on remittances, though this money barely lasts a week `[40]`.

**Question:**  What are the reported psychological impacts of food insecurity on caregivers, as illustrated by the experiences of individuals like St-Louis?
**Answer:** Caregivers, such as St-Louis, have reported significant psychological impacts due to food insecurity, including feeling "sometimes so depressed that I sometimes want to kill the kids and myself"[41][42][43][44]. Judeline Auguste also described her situation as "hard not because of me, but because of my son"[42][44], who cries from hunger[46]. Jean Yonel, another caregiver, stated he "can't provide every day for these children"[46].

### Urgent Humanitarian Needs for Displaced Families in Artibonite, Haiti

**Question:** How is the humanitarian response addressing the needs of vulnerable groups among the displaced, such as pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and children under five?
**Answer:** Families with pregnant or breastfeeding women and/or children under five receive additional support to prevent malnutrition[1].

**Question:** How are the 88 individuals staying with host families in La Chapelle, Montrouis, Petite Rivière de l'Artibonite, and Saint-Marc being supported, and what additional resources are required to sustain these arrangements?
**Answer:** The provided sources do not contain information relevant to how the 88 individuals staying with host families in La Chapelle, Montrouis, Petite Rivière de l'Artibonite, and Saint-Marc are being supported, nor what additional resources are required to sustain these arrangements. While 88 individuals (or 88% of the displaced) sought refuge with relatives or host families in these communes following attacks on October 3, 2024[11][12][13][14], the specific details of their support and required resources are not provided.

**Question:** How are the host communities in Artibonite Department coping with the influx of 6,270 displaced individuals, and what support mechanisms are in place to assist them?
**Answer:** Following attacks in the commune of Saint Marc, Artibonite Department, on October 3, 2024, a total of 6,270 individuals (1,281 households) were displaced[21][22][25][27]. As displacement continued, 88 percent of those affected sought refuge with relatives or other host families in the communes of La Chapelle, Montrouis, Petite Rivire de l'Artibonite, and Saint-Marc[25][27]. The remaining 12 percent found refuge in three separate sites[21]. The vast majority of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in provinces are hosted by host families[28]. The municipalities of Verrettes and Saint-Marc host almost half of the IDPs in Artibonite[29].

The provided sources do not contain information on how host communities in Artibonite Department are coping with this influx or what specific support mechanisms are in place to assist them.

### Haiti Displacement Crisis: Urgent Need for Increased Humanitarian Support

**Question:**  What are the specific challenges faced by host communities in Haiti, particularly in terms of food shortages, healthcare facilities, and access to essential supplies, as reported by the International Organization for Migration (IOM)?
**Answer:** Host communities in Haiti face immense strain on resources[1]. The majority of host households report significant difficulties, including food shortages, overwhelmed healthcare facilities, and a lack of essential supplies on local markets[1]. This information was reported by the International Organization for Migration (IOM)[9].

**Question:**  How is the International Organization for Migration (IOM) collaborating with partners to ensure humanitarian assistance reaches displaced individuals in inaccessible areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince?
**Answer:** In some of the inaccessible areas, including most of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is collaborating with partners to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches those displaced[11].

**Question:**  What proportion of displaced individuals in Haiti are currently residing in the Grand Sud region, and how does this compare to the number of displaced individuals in Port-au-Prince?
**Answer:** The Grand Sud region alone hosts 45 per cent of all displaced individuals in Haiti[21]. The capital Port-au-Prince hosts a quarter of the country's displaced[21].

**Question:**  What are the demographics and locations of the newly displaced households and individuals in the Artibonite Department, specifically in the municipality of Saint Marc, as observed by the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) of the IOM?
**Answer:** The Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) of the IOM observed displacement following attacks in the municipality of Saint Marc, Artibonite Department[32].

In this area, there are 1,281 displaced households and 6,270 displaced individuals[31]. Among these, 3 new sites are hosting 750 displaced individuals[31]. A total of 1,146 households and 5,520 individuals are located on sites[31]. Displaced individuals also took refuge with host families[31].

The locations of these displaced individuals include the municipalities of Saint Marc, Montruis, La Chapelle, and Petite Riviere de l'Artibonite[32]. Specific communal sections hosting displaced individuals are 5e section Bocozelle[32], 4e Section Lalouere[32], 2e Section Bois Neuf[32], 6e section Charrette[39], 1re Section Deluge[39], 1re Section St Martin[39], and 4e Section Savane Roche[39]. Specific site names include Portail des Guepes[31], Ecole Nationale Antoinette Dessalines[32], Venotte Grande Rue- Rue Christophe[32], and DUCO Place Phillippe Guerrier[32].

**Question:**  How are local and international humanitarian organizations addressing the underfunding of the humanitarian response in Haiti, and what percentage of the required funding has been met to date?
**Answer:** Local and international humanitarian organizations are urgently calling for support to address the underfunding of the humanitarian response in Haiti[42]. The IOM has called for greater international attention on the crisis and urged the international community to step up its support for Haiti's displaced populations and host communities[41]. To date, less than 36 percent of the required funding for the humanitarian response in Haiti has been met[42].

### Project HOPE Delivers Critical Aid Amid Escalating Violence in Haiti's Grand Sud

**Question:**  How is Project HOPE addressing the strain on the local healthcare system in Haiti's Grand Sud region caused by ongoing violence?
**Answer:** Project HOPE is delivering critical health and humanitarian assistance in Haiti's Grand Sud region to address the ongoing violence and its strain on the local health care system[11][12].

**Question:**  What are the primary factors contributing to the 22% increase in internal displacement in Haiti since June, as reported by the International Organization for Migration (IOM)?
**Answer:** The 22% increase in internal displacement in Haiti since June, as reported by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), is primarily attributed to gang violence[21][22][26]. This violence has forced over 110,000 people to flee their homes in the last seven months[21][22].

### Haiti's Security Crisis: Urgent Need for Enhanced International Support and Funding

**Question:**  What are the key challenges faced by the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) in coordinating with Haitian authorities and other stakeholders to enhance security and provide humanitarian assistance?
**Answer:** The provided sources indicate several key challenges impacting efforts to enhance security and provide humanitarian assistance in Haiti. These challenges include:

*   **Security Crisis:** Haiti faces an "unprecedented security crisis"[5]and has been unstable since 2021 following the assassination of President Jovenel Moise[8]. Citizens live in fear of moving freely, particularly around Port-au-Prince[5].
*   **Restricted Humanitarian Access:** Armed groups have severely restricted access to essential humanitarian aid[4].
*   **Funding and Capacity Shortfalls for Security Missions:** The Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, which aims to enhance security, has faced a "continued shortfall in funds, equipment and logistics capabilities"[6].
*   **Humanitarian Needs:** Over 700,000 people have been forcibly displaced due to violence and insecurity[4]. Many of these displaced individuals face severe shortages of food, water, shelter, and medical care, in addition to severe protection risks[3][4].
*   **Issues with National Police and Corruption:** Rights advocates have called for more support and training for Haiti's national police force, as well as an end to corruption[10].

While the Head of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH), Maria Isabel Salvador, is noted to have met with key stakeholders, including Haitian officials and other UN agencies[1], the provided sources do not explicitly detail specific challenges faced by BINUH in coordinating with Haitian authorities and other stakeholders[10].

**Question:**  What are the key challenges faced by humanitarian agencies in delivering aid to communities affected by armed groups in Haiti, and how can international partners help overcome these obstacles?
**Answer:** Humanitarian agencies face key challenges in delivering aid in Haiti, as armed groups have severely restricted access to essential humanitarian assistance[11][12]. This has deepened the crisis for vulnerable communities[12], who experience severe shortages of food, water, shelter, and medical care, in addition to severe protection risks[11][12]. Citizens also live in fear of moving freely, particularly around the capital Port-au-Prince[15]. Furthermore, the mission has encountered a continued shortfall in funds, equipment, and logistics capabilities[19].

International partners can help overcome these obstacles through increased funding, enhanced security, and international solidarity[13]. There is a call for increased and urgent attention, support, and solutions for Haitians affected by violence and insecurity[11][12]. It is crucial that efforts to restore stability and security continue alongside humanitarian aid[15]. Stable and predictable financing, as well as expanded capacities for the force, are necessary[18]. The UN Secretary-General may offer logistical support to the mission, subject to full financial reimbursement through available voluntary contributions[15]. Additionally, rights advocates have called for more support and training for Haiti's national police force, an end to corruption, and a Haitian-led political process[18]. UNHCR has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Haitian authorities and the UN Country Team's efforts[13]. Haiti's stability will ultimately be achieved through a multi-pronged approach that addresses the root causes of its challenges[16].

**Question:**  What are the key protection risks faced by internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Port-au-Prince and Ouanaminthe, and how is the UNHCR working to mitigate these risks?
**Answer:** Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Port-au-Prince and Ouanaminthe face severe protection risks[22], in addition to severe shortages of food, water, shelter, and medical care[21][22].

UNHCR is working to mitigate these risks by calling for increased and urgent attention, support, and solutions for Haitians affected by violence and insecurity, including those forcibly displaced[21][23]. UNHCR also reaffirms its commitment to supporting Haitian authorities and the UN Country Team's efforts to address the protection and humanitarian needs of Haitians within the country and throughout the Latin American and Caribbean region[24]. Furthermore, UNHCR works in Haiti to improve access to birth registration, which is critical for ensuring Haitians can exercise their rights and prevent statelessness[24]. Outside of Haiti, UNHCR continues to engage with governments and partners to ensure Haitians have access to protection and solutions[24].

**Question:**  What are the main logistical and financial challenges faced by the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission in Haiti, and how might transforming it into a UN peacekeeping operation address these issues?
**Answer:** The Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission in Haiti has faced a continued shortfall in funds, equipment, and logistics capabilities[31]. Transforming the MSS into a peacekeeping operation under the mandate of the United Nations is considered necessary and urgent[31]. This transformation would guarantee more stable and predictable financing and expand the force's capacities[31].

**Question:**  In what ways can increased funding and enhanced security measures contribute to restoring stability and providing life-saving humanitarian assistance in Haiti, as emphasized by UNHCR's Assistant High Commissioner for Operations, Raouf Mazou?
**Answer:** Increased funding, enhanced security, and international solidarity are essential to providing life-saving humanitarian assistance and restoring stability and hope in Haiti[41]. UNHCR, through its Assistant High Commissioner for Operations, Raouf Mazou, calls for increased and urgent attention, support, and solutions for Haitians affected by violence and insecurity[43][44]. Mazou witnessed the devastating impact of the country's dire security situation, where armed groups have severely restricted access to essential humanitarian aid[43][44]. He also heard about severe shortages of food, water, shelter, medical care, and protection risks[44], emphasizing that Haitians need collective support[45].

### Urgent Mobilization Needed to Protect Children and Address Health Crises in Haiti

**Question:** What measures are currently in place to protect children from recruitment by gangs in Port-au-Prince, and how effective have they been?
**Answer:** Children are increasingly targeted for recruitment by gangs[1]. However, the provided sources do not contain information on specific measures currently in place to protect children from recruitment by gangs in Port-au-Prince, nor do they discuss the effectiveness of any such measures.

**Question:** What resources are needed to prepare for the anticipated rise in waterborne diseases in eastern Haiti due to La Niña, and how can these resources be mobilized effectively?
**Answer:** The anticipated above-average rainfall and temperature created by La Niña in eastern Haiti could lead to a rise in waterborne diseases, requiring increased medical care for both displaced and host communities[21][22].

Resources needed include:
*   Health, protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services[23].
*   Primary health care, pharmaceuticals and medicines, and promotion of sanitation and hygiene[28].
*   Hygiene promotion and awareness-raising activities, covering topics such as hand hygiene, food safety, and waste management[25].
*   Clean water sources[30].
*   Response to extreme weather and health crises[28].
*   Training frontline health workers[28].

These resources can be mobilized effectively through:
*   Project HOPE's response in departments such as Sud, Nippes, and Grand'Anse[23].
*   Programs that increase access to primary health care and protection services[28].
*   Mobile clinic activities[28].
*   Hygiene promotion activities[28].

**Question:** How can humanitarian organizations enhance their response to the increasing number of internally displaced people (IDPs) due to gang violence in Port-au-Prince?
**Answer:** Humanitarian organizations can enhance their response by addressing health, protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) needs[31]. This includes increasing access to primary health care and protection services[33], training frontline health workers, and providing pharmaceuticals and medicines[32]. They can also provide psychosocial support through Program Management Plus (PM) group sessions and follow-up services[40], and strengthen mental health and gender-based violence (GBV) prevention resources by offering referral services[32]. Furthermore, organizations can distribute hygiene kits to internally displaced people (IDPs)[32]and promote sanitation and hygiene through awareness-raising activities covering topics such as hand hygiene, food safety, and waste management[40]. Responding to extreme weather and health crises is also part of the response[31], as is providing increased medical care for both displaced and host communities due to potential waterborne diseases[34]. Mobile clinic activities can also be utilized[32].

**Question:** How can healthcare services be expanded to meet the increased demand for medical care among displaced and host communities in Haiti?
**Answer:** Healthcare services can be expanded to meet the increased demand for medical care among displaced and host communities in Haiti by increasing access to primary health care[42], training frontline health workers[45], and providing pharmaceuticals and medicines[45]. Project HOPE, which responds to health needs in the Sud, Nippes, and Grand'Anse departments[43], also addresses extreme weather and health crises[45]. Mobile clinic activities are utilized to reach internally displaced people (IDPs)[47]. Furthermore, strengthening mental health and gender-based violence (GBV) prevention resources, providing referral services, psychosocial support through group sessions, and follow-up services contribute to meeting these needs[50]. The demand for increased medical care is anticipated due to potential rises in waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, salmonellosis, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever[41][42], as well as increased internal displacement[41]and an increase in rape and other GBV in gang-controlled areas and IDP sites[47].

**Question:** How can humanitarian aid be optimized to address the potential food shortages resulting from gang-imposed roadblocks and reduced agricultural output?
**Answer:** Humanitarian aid can be optimized through mobile response teams and flexible assistance modalities, including Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA)[52]. Organizations provide tailored in-kind assistance, distribute kits, and offer cash and voucher assistance[54]. Support to civil society actors, such as community kitchens, can be expanded to increase their capacity to aid those on the move[52]. Additionally, access to income generation sources can be supported[52]. Mobile units are operated to address immediate needs[57]. These measures are relevant given that gang-imposed roadblocks hinder humanitarian access[51]and can make food less available and accessible[59], while agricultural production has been below the seasonal average due to insecurity affecting access to land, seeds, and labor[53].

### Urgent Need for Enhanced Protection and Services for Displaced Women in Haiti

**Question:**  What specific measures are being taken by the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, led by Kenyan police forces, to improve public safety and protect critical infrastructure in Haiti, and how do these efforts impact the overall security situation?
**Answer:** The Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, led by Kenyan police forces, is working to secure public safety and protect critical infrastructure, including the airport and critical roads[1][2]. The force numbers around 400 personnel, with more than a dozen officers from Jamaica and Belize also participating[3][4]. While an improvement in the security situation has been reported[6], the provided sources do not explicitly detail how these specific efforts by the MSS mission directly impact the overall security situation.

**Question:**  How are the current living conditions in displacement sites contributing to the increased risk of gender-based violence (GBV) for women and girls, and what immediate actions can be taken to improve safety and security in these areas?
**Answer:** Current living conditions in displacement sites contribute to an increased risk of gender-based violence (GBV) for women and girls due to poor living conditions and a lack of basic necessities, resources, food, and water[11][12][14]. Food insecurity, along with the scarcity and high costs of products at markets, amplifies their vulnerability to violence, sexual exploitation, and abuse, leading to increased reliance on harmful coping mechanisms[13][15]. Specific risks in surveyed displacement sites include more than half of latrines and many showers not being separated by gender, several showers lacking locks, and many sites without nighttime lighting[18]. Additionally, groups of armed men often attack women and girls as they travel to work or school[14].

To improve safety and security, women and girls urgently need protection services, as well as access to reproductive health services, shelter, food, water, sanitation, and hygiene[13][15]. UNFPA and its partners deploy mobile teams to IDP sites to provide integrated sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and GBV services[13][16]. They also offer remote psychosocial support, referrals, case documentation, and GBV information via a hotline, and conduct awareness-raising activities on GBV and SRH[13][16]. Four temporary women and girls' safe spaces are operational in sites to address gaps in psychosocial support and case management services[16]. UNFPA continues to support and strengthen GBV coordination mechanisms at the national level and among humanitarian actors, and works to mainstream GBV into the humanitarian response[13][16]. Improving overall security conditions is also the primary factor reported by households considering returning home[11]. However, current efforts to protect women and girls from violence are not being delivered at the scale needed, with only 15 out of 85 IDP sites in Haiti currently receiving protection services[15][17].

**Question:**  How are food insecurity and the high costs of market products exacerbating the vulnerability of women and girls to sexual exploitation and abuse in Haiti, and what interventions are being planned to mitigate these risks?
**Answer:** Food insecurity and the scarcity and costs of products at markets are amplifying the vulnerability of women and girls to violence, sexual exploitation, and abuse, and increasing their reliance on harmful coping mechanisms[21][22]. The risks of sexual violence in displacement sites have also risen, partly due to poor living conditions, with a lack of resources, access to food, water, and high market prices being contributing factors[23][24].

To mitigate these risks, a round table provided an opportunity for gender-based violence (GBV) actors, women's associations, government, UN agencies, and NGOs to identify concrete actions to address GBV[26]. UNFPA also continues its efforts to strengthen GBV coordination mechanisms among humanitarian actors and to build the capacities of other sectors to ensure GBV mainstreaming into the humanitarian response[22]. In terms of ongoing interventions, UNFPA and its implementing partners continue to provide sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and GBV services where access is possible and security allows[22][25]. These services include deploying mobile teams to IDP sites for integrated SRHGBV services, offering remote psychosocial support, referrals, case documentation, and GBV information via a hotline, and conducting awareness-raising activities[22]. Additionally, four temporary women and girls' safe spaces are operational in IDP sites to address gaps in psychosocial support and case management services[22]. Despite these efforts, current protection services for women and girls are not being delivered at the scale needed[21][27], with only 15 out of 85 IDP sites in Haiti currently receiving such services[21][27].

**Question:**  What are the primary barriers preventing internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Metropolitan Area of Port-au-Prince (MAPAP) from accessing essential protection services, and how can these barriers be addressed to ensure comprehensive support for survivors of GBV?
**Answer:** The primary barriers preventing internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Metropolitan Area of Port-au-Prince (MAPAP) and other displacement sites from accessing essential protection services include:

*   **Limited Service Availability:** Only 15 out of 85 IDP sites in Haiti receive protection services, including those for survivors of gender-based violence (GBV)[31][32]. Current efforts to protect women and girls from violence are not being delivered at the scale needed[31][32].
*   **Insecurity and Violence:** Humanitarian access is challenged by risks of attacks and abductions[33]. Insecurity blocks access to safe spaces[37]. Criminal incidents, including armed robberies, burglaries, and kidnappings, have increased, particularly in MAPAP[33][34]. Groups of armed men often attack women and girls as they travel[33].
*   **Poor Living Conditions:** The risks of sexual violence in displacement sites have risen due to poor living conditions[33][34]. Specific issues include more than half of latrines and many showers not separated by gender, several showers lacking locks, and many sites without nighttime lighting[38].
*   **Lack of Resources and Capacity:** Access to health services after sexual violence is scarce[37]. Only 3% of rape cases were treated within 72 hours due to access constraints, a lack of medicine, inadequate resources for case management and referrals, inadequacy or absence of care facilities, and a lack of trained staff[37].
*   **Underreporting:** GBV cases are likely underreported due to fear of revictimization and stigmatization, and the lack of an effective justice system[37].
*   **Funding Shortfalls:** A $674 million humanitarian appeal for Haiti has received just over a third (36%) of its funding[34][40], and UNFPA has mobilized only 19% of its required funding[40].
*   **Food Insecurity and High Costs:** Food insecurity, scarcity, and high costs of market products amplify the vulnerability of women and girls to violence, sexual exploitation, and abuse, increasing reliance on harmful coping mechanisms[32][36].

To address these barriers and ensure comprehensive support for survivors of GBV:

*   **Increase Service Provision:** Urgent needs include protection services, reproductive health services, shelter, food, water, sanitation, and hygiene[32].
*   **Improve Security:** Improving security conditions is the primary factor reported by households considering returning home[34][40]. The Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission continues to support the Haitian National Police to secure public safety and protect critical infrastructure[38][39][40].
*   **Deploy Mobile and Remote Services:** UNFPA and its partners deploy mobile teams to IDP sites to provide integrated sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and GBV services[35][36]. They also offer remote psychosocial support, referrals, case documentation, and GBV information via a hotline[35].
*   **Establish Safe Spaces:** Four temporary women and girls' safe spaces are operational in sites to address gaps in psychosocial support and case management services[35].
*   **Strengthen Coordination and Capacity:** UNFPA continues to strengthen GBV coordination mechanisms among humanitarian actors and build the capacities of other sectors to mainstream GBV into the humanitarian response[35]. A round table was held for GBV actors, women's associations, government, UN agencies, and NGOs to identify concrete actions[33].
*   **Conduct Awareness Activities:** Project HOPE provided mental health and GBV awareness activities to 9,974 people[39]. UNFPA conducts awareness-raising activities on GBV and SRH and available services[35].

**Question:**  How is the ongoing gang violence in areas like Cit Soleil, Ganthier, and Bas-Delmas affecting the displacement patterns and humanitarian needs of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Haiti?
**Answer:** Gang violence in areas such as Cit Soleil, Ganthier, and Bas-Delmas continues to drive displacement[41]. More than 700,000 persons are internally displaced across the country[42][43], with approximately 702,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Haiti, including 37% in the Metropolitan Area of Port-au-Prince (MAPAP)[45]. The number of IDPs in MAPAP has decreased, reflecting a continued outflow of people to provinces, albeit at a lower volume compared to March to April 2024[45][46].

The ongoing displacement significantly impacts humanitarian needs. Displaced women and girls are particularly affected by the crisis[43][44]and struggle to secure even the most basic necessities[45]. The risks of sexual violence in displacement sites have risen, partly due to poor living conditions[43][44]. Women and girls urgently need protection services, access to reproductive health services, shelter, food, water, sanitation, and hygiene[41][46]. Food insecurity, along with the scarcity and high costs of products at markets, amplifies their vulnerability to violence, sexual exploitation, and abuse, increasing reliance on harmful coping mechanisms[41][46]. Around 94% of women and girls are at risk of gender-based violence (GBV), with almost three-quarters (72%) of GBV incidents being sexual violence[41][42]. Currently, only 15 out of 85 IDP sites in Haiti receive protection services, including services for survivors of GBV[45][46]. Risks noted in surveyed displacement sites include more than half of latrines and many showers not separated by gender, several showers without locks, and many sites lacking nighttime lighting[47]. Humanitarian access remains a challenge, impacting service provision in areas where there are risks of attacks and abductions[43][44].

### World Leaders Urged to Commit Resources for Haiti's Humanitarian Crisis Response

**Question:**  What specific financial, technical, and logistical commitments are being proposed by world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly to address the humanitarian crisis in Haiti, particularly in response to the control of 300 violent criminal groups in Port-au-Prince?
**Answer:** World leaders gathering in New York for the United Nations General Assembly have an opportunity to give Haiti attention through concrete financial, technical, and logistical commitments[1]. Immediate and coordinated action is essential to make a difference for millions of Haitians whose lives are at risk[1]. This is in response to Haiti being engulfed by one of the world's worst humanitarian and security crises, where some 300 violent criminal groups control nearly 80 percent of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince and are increasingly active in rural areas[1]. However, the provided sources do not specify the exact nature of these proposed financial, technical, and logistical commitments.

**Question:**  What infrastructure developments are being prioritized to improve economic opportunities and public service delivery in Haiti, and how do these developments address the vulnerabilities exacerbated by gang violence?
**Answer:** Haiti is prioritizing the development of resilient infrastructure to improve economic opportunities, especially for the rural population in agricultural value chains, for public service delivery, and to make urban mobility systems more inclusive[12]. This includes the construction of a hundred bridges to connect rural communities to public markets, opportunities, and basic services such as health and education[12]. Important road construction and rehabilitation are being realized in Les Cayes[19], with the connection of rural communities facilitating quick access to humanitarian relief[12].

The World Bank Group is engaged in improving early warning systems, providing safe havens, and strengthening the government's emergency response capacity[11]. The new National Emergency Operations Center, partly financed by the International Development Association (IDA), will facilitate better coordination among at-risk populations before, during, or after climatic, geological, or other events[15]. Ongoing projects also include departmental and communal Emergency Operation Centers and construction sites for safe havens[15], as well as rural houses built during hands-on training in improved local construction techniques[15]. Additionally, Project HOPE is working to improve sanitation and waste management at Hospital Immaculee Conception in Les Cayes and Hospital Saint Antoine in Jeremie through targeted WASH repairs and rehabilitation works, including the construction of shower cubicles, installation of a sump pump and water tank, and rehabilitation of latrine blocks[19].

Regarding how these developments address vulnerabilities exacerbated by gang violence, the provided sources indicate that gang violence continues in Haiti[14], with violent criminal groups controlling nearly 80 percent of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince and increasingly active in rural areas[16]. These groups prevent the free movement of people and goods[16]and can interrupt national and local supply chains unexpectedly[17]. However, the sources do not explicitly detail how the prioritized infrastructure developments directly address vulnerabilities exacerbated by gang violence.

**Question:**  How is the Haitian government planning to restructure existing operations with the World Bank to deliver targeted and timely results in communities affected by gang violence?
**Answer:** The Haitian Government will work closely with the World Bank on restructuring existing operations with the aim to deliver targeted and timely results on the ground[21]. The World Bank has adopted a strong rural focus, with over 80% of its programs implemented in more stable communities outside of Port-Au-Prince, with the aim of promoting access to sustainable basic services[21]. The World Bank is also supporting the Haitian government in strengthening resilience and promoting the resumption of economic activities by financing key sectors and enhancing reliable access to basic services and livelihoods[21]. Haiti is facing increasing armed group violence[22], with violent criminal groups increasingly active in the country's rural areas[26]. However, the provided sources do not detail how the restructuring of operations specifically targets communities affected by gang violence.

**Question:**  How is Project HOPE addressing the healthcare needs of communities affected by gang violence in the Sud and Grand'Anse departments, and what specific services are being provided to internally displaced persons?
**Answer:** Project HOPE addresses healthcare needs in the Sud and Grand'Anse departments by supporting five health facilities that provide primary health care services, including infectious disease, noncommunicable disease, sexual and reproductive health, clinical mental health, and GBV care consultations[31]. In August, Project HOPE staff cared for 2,853 patients at these facilities, treating 485 for communicable diseases, 973 for non-communicable diseases, 623 for injuries, 10 for mental health disorders, 363 for reproductive health services, and 399 for other health issues[31].

In response to communities in need of mental health care, psychological support, and GBV prevention and care, Project HOPE conducted awareness-raising activities on GBV and mental health in the Sud and Nippes departments, reaching over 9,900 people[32]. These activities highlighted topics such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, physical violence, harmful traditional practices, and stress management[32]. Project HOPE also increased the number of mobile medical units (MMUs) from one to eight per week, which doubled the number of patients assisted[33]. As gang violence continues, Project HOPE plans to continue providing medical supplies and essentials to MMUs and health facilities to promote a stronger health system[31].

Regarding internally displaced persons, 887 individuals were among the 8,681 patients served, with 284 identified as male and 603 as female[31]. The provided sources do not specify the exact services provided to these internally displaced persons.

### WFP Emergency Aid and Education Initiatives Amidst Port-au-Prince Challenges

**Question:**  **Food Distribution and Impact:** How has the World Food Programme's (WFP) distribution of 1,240 metric tons of food and USD 1.9 million in cash-based transfers (CBT) impacted food security among the 93,715 people reached, particularly the 7,220 internally displaced people (IDPs) in Port-au-Prince?
**Answer:** The World Food Programme (WFP) reached 93,715 people with 1,240 MT of food and 79,220 people with USD 1.9 million in cash-based transfers (CBT) through an emergency programme[1]. WFP also distributed 62,615 hot meals to 16,628 people, with the majority (43,816 hot meals) going to 7,220 internally displaced people (IDPs) in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince[1]. The provided sources describe these distributions but do not explicitly detail their impact on food security for the 93,715 people reached or the 7,220 IDPs in Port-au-Prince.

**Question:** What alternative educational resources or support systems are being developed to assist children who are unable to attend school due to overcrowding and lack of access to online courses, especially in areas affected by gang violence?
**Answer:** A summer camp programme was implemented during the closure of schools in Port-au-Prince[14]. This initiative specifically targeted four schools located in Cit Soleil Brooklyn, Drouillard, and Kenscoff[14].

**Question:**  **Nutritional Screening and Treatment:** What are the outcomes of WFP's screening of 12,439 children for malnutrition, and how effective have the referrals to health facilities been in treating the 1,486 identified as moderately malnourished?
**Answer:** WFP partners screened 12,439 children[41]. Out of those screened, 1,486 children were identified as moderately malnourished[41]. All these children were referred to health facilities for treatment[41]. The provided sources do not contain information on how effective these referrals have been in treating the 1,486 identified as moderately malnourished.

### Urgent International Support Needed for Humanitarian Crisis in Pont-Sond, Haiti

**Question:**  What immediate humanitarian needs have been identified in Pont-Sond, Haiti, following the recent attack, and how can aid organizations prioritize their response to address these needs effectively?
**Answer:** Following the recent attack in Pont-Sond, Haiti, immediate humanitarian needs include care for the injured[4], support for the medical system, including the area's lone and overwhelmed hospital, and the provision of medical supplies[2]. There is also a dire humanitarian situation marked by gender-based violence, including sexual violence, mass displacement, and extreme hunger[3][4]. Support is needed for survivors of sexual violence and vulnerable children[1].

To address these needs effectively, more international support and coordination are needed[1]. Aid organizations and other groups currently lack sufficient resources to effectively address the challenges[1]. Prioritization should include restoring state control, ensuring residents have access to basic necessities such as food, health care, and education, rebuilding the justice system, and implementing programs to support survivors of sexual violence and vulnerable children[1].

**Question:**  What resources and support are required by the transitional government and humanitarian organizations to effectively address the challenges of mass displacement, extreme hunger, and the collapse of the medical system in Haiti?
**Answer:** The transitional government requires significant resources to restore state control and ensure residents have access to basic necessities, including food and health care[11]. The government, the MSS, and humanitarian and human rights groups in Haiti do not have sufficient resources to effectively address the challenges[11]. More international support and coordination are needed[11].

**Question:**  How are local and international entities, such as the European Union and the UN Human Rights Office, coordinating their efforts to respond to the escalating violence in Haiti, and what additional support is needed?
**Answer:** The European Union condemned the violence in a statement on Friday[22], and the UN Human Rights Office of the Commissioner stated it was "horrified by Thursday's gang attacks"[22]. However, the provided sources do not contain information on how these specific entities are coordinating their efforts.

More international support and coordination are needed[21]. The transitional government requires significant resources to restore state control, ensure residents have access to basic necessities like food, health care, and education, rebuild the justice system, and implement programs to support survivors of sexual violence and vulnerable children in areas controlled by criminal groups[21]. The government, the MSS, and humanitarian and human rights groups working in Haiti currently lack the necessary resources to effectively address the challenges[21].

**Question:**  How is the Haitian government addressing the issue of gender-based violence, including sexual violence, in the context of the current humanitarian crisis, and what programs are in place to support survivors?
**Answer:** The humanitarian crisis in Haiti is marked by gender-based violence, including sexual violence[33][35]. The transitional government will need significant resources to implement programs to support survivors of sexual violence and vulnerable children in areas controlled by criminal groups[31]. More international support and coordination are needed for this[31]. The mission will support the Haitian National Police in restoring basic security and state control and ensuring respect for human rights[31]. Prime Minister Garry Conille has vowed that perpetrators will face the full force of the law, stating they need to be arrested, brought to justice, and imprisoned, and that victims need to receive restitution[32][34].

**Question:**  What specific measures are being taken by the Haitian National Police to restore basic security and state control in Pont-Sond and surrounding areas affected by gang violence?
**Answer:** Haiti's government deployed an elite police unit from Port-au-Prince to Pont-Sond following the attack[52]. This police unit will remain in the area for as long as it takes to guarantee safety[52].

### Armed Gangs Disrupt Aid and Food Supply in Port-au-Prince, Haiti

**Question:**  What percentage of Port-au-Prince is currently under the control of armed gangs, and how does this impact the delivery of humanitarian aid and food distribution in the region?
**Answer:** Armed gangs control "up to 90 per cent"[21]or 80 percent[26]of Port-au-Prince. This control significantly impacts humanitarian aid and food distribution. Road access is cut off by gangs, making it difficult for many humanitarian organizations to deliver aid[21]. Supplies from southern Haiti, a key region for food distribution, have been blocked for months[21]. The cost of food has skyrocketed as trucks are forced to pay high bribes to pass through[25][28], and road closures between Port-au-Prince and the provinces make it difficult for local farmers to buy and sell agricultural products on the main markets[25][28]. This situation fuels hunger[23]and causes people to struggle accessing and affording nutritious food[21].

### Haiti Crisis: Urgent Need for Enhanced Support to MSS Mission

**Question:**  What strategies are being implemented to address the displacement of over 700,000 people in Haiti due to gang violence, and how are humanitarian organizations supporting these efforts?
**Answer:** Over 700,000 people are displaced in Haiti due to gang violence[11].

The primary strategy being implemented to address this issue is the UN-backed Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, led by Kenya, which began in late June[17]. This mission aims to quell gang violence[11], enhance national security, and establish conditions for free and fair elections[14]. It has liberated some communities[12]and achieved initial successes in collaboration with the Haitian National Police (HNP), including securing the airport and other key infrastructure[18]. Kenyan police officers have been deployed under this mission, with around 400 initially[19]and approximately 600 deployed between June and July 2024[13]. Kenya plans to send 600 more police officers from this month to January to support the national police force[19]. The mission's personnel have concentrated on crucial defense duties, such as protecting airports and oil terminals[13]. For the mission to create conditions for Haitian authorities to secure their country and undertake social and economic reconstruction, it needs to rapidly achieve the full deployment of its envisioned 2,500 personnel and acquire substantial resources[18]. There are calls for increased international financial and logistical assistance to the Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti[11][16][17].

The provided sources state that the UN's migration agency reported on the displacement numbers[11]and describe Haiti as facing a worsening humanitarian crisis with alarming rates of gang violence[12]. However, the sources do not detail specific strategies being implemented directly for the displaced population (e.g., shelter, aid distribution, resettlement programs) or how humanitarian organizations are supporting these specific efforts beyond reporting on the crisis and calling for increased assistance to the MSS mission[11][16].

**Question:**  How is the ongoing gang violence in Haiti affecting the country's economic stability and social fabric, and what measures are being proposed to mitigate these impacts?
**Answer:** Ongoing gang violence in Haiti is severely impacting the country's social fabric and economic stability[24]. It continues to rend the social fabric, multiplying human rights violations and plunging thousands of families into distress[21]. Insecurity is omnipresent, paralyzing the economy and undermining institutions[21]. The violence has left over 700,000 people homeless in recent years[23], with more than 700,000 people now displaced, over half of whom are children[24]. It disrupts daily life, forces people to flee their homes, and causes acute food insecurity to rise[23]. More than 3,600 people had been killed in gang violence this year as of last week[24], with an estimated 3,661 killed since January, amounting to over 13 deaths daily[27][28].

To mitigate these impacts, a UN-backed Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission led by Kenya began in late June[23]. This mission aims to quell gang violence[24]and maintain its gains to enhance national security and establish conditions for free and fair elections[21]. Around 600 Kenyan police officers were deployed between June and July 2024[25], with Jamaica deploying soldiers in September to support them[28]. Kenyan police have focused on crucial defense duties, including protecting key infrastructure like airports and oil terminals[25]. The mission has achieved some initial successes, including securing the airport and other key infrastructure[26]. However, officials state much work remains[23], and there are calls for increased international financial and logistical assistance to the MSS mission[24][27][28]. The mission needs to rapidly achieve the full deployment of its envisioned 2,500 personnel, up from the current 410 officers, and secure substantial resources[26]. Kenya plans to send 600 more police officers to Haiti from this month to January[29].

**Question:**  How is the Multinational Security Support (MSS) Mission in Haiti being supported financially and logistically by the international community, and what additional resources are needed to enhance its effectiveness?
**Answer:** The Multinational Security Support (MSS) Mission in Haiti is supported by the deployment of personnel, with approximately 400[32]to 600[39]Kenyan police officers having been deployed[39]. The mission currently has 410 officers[33], and Kenya plans to send 600 more police officers[39]. Jamaican soldiers were also deployed on September 12 to support the Kenyan police[33]. Kenya is leading the mission[39].

To enhance its effectiveness, there are calls for increased international financial and logistical assistance[31][32][35]. Urgent reinforcement and substantial resources are needed[31], as the current mission lacks funding and personnel[38]. The mission must rapidly achieve the full deployment of its envisioned 2,500 personnel, an increase from the current 410 officers[34].

### Haiti Faces Severe Humanitarian Crisis: Urgent Need for Aid and Support

**Question:**  What are the specific shortages of wheat flour and rice in the communes of Anse d'Hainault, Cap-Haïtien, Jacmel, Saint Jean du Sud, Aquin, Pestel, Chardonnières, and Anse Galets, and how are these shortages impacting local food security?
**Answer:** Some shortages of wheat flour and rice are present in the communes of Anse d'Hainault, Cap-Haïtien, Jacmel, Saint Jean du Sud, Aquin, Pestel, Chardonnières, and Anse Galets[1]. These shortages contribute to a variation in the cost of the food basket[1]. A significant increase in the cost of the food basket, reaching up to 16%, has been observed in certain regions, particularly Nord-Ouest and Sud[1].

**Question:** What are the current capacities and limitations of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in distributing shelter kits, kitchen kits, and non-food item (NFI) kits to displaced populations in Haiti?
**Answer:** The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is ready to distribute shelter kits, kitchen kits, and non-food item (NFI) kits[11][12]. However, the distribution of humanitarian aid nationwide has been affected by logistical disruptions, such as airport closures between February and May, and sporadic seaport closures dependent on security conditions[15]. Humanitarian organizations, including IOM, also face challenges in accessing communities located in areas controlled by armed groups[18]. Violent attacks and fighting linked to armed groups in early 2024 caused shipping and airport operations to temporarily cease, further impacting distribution[18].

**Question:**  How is the significant increase in the cost of the food basket, particularly in the Nord-Ouest and Sud regions, affecting household food security and access to nutrition?
**Answer:** The cost of the food basket significantly increased, reaching up to 16% in Nord-Ouest and 14% in Sud[31]. This food inflation is a major factor limiting displaced people's access to food[38], with food expenditure now accounting for up to 70% of total household expenditure[32]. Severe malnutrition remains a primary challenge across Haiti, particularly in the Sud department[40], and families are struggling with extreme food shortages and spiralling malnutrition[36].

**Question:**  What measures are being taken to address the high inflation rate and the fact that food expenditure accounts for up to 70 percent of total household expenditure in Haiti?
**Answer:** The provided sources state that inflation remains high and food expenditure accounts for up to 70 percent of total household expenditure[41]. Food prices have risen by 40% since the beginning of 2024, driven by supply chain disruptions caused by insecurity and anticipated low production from the spring harvest[44]. Agricultural production in 2024 has been below the seasonal average due to erratic rainfall and overall insecurity affecting access to land, seed availability, and labor costs[41].

While humanitarian food assistance is expected to be a priority need for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host communities[43], and there are calls for broad-based support to increase lifesaving assistance to families facing extreme food shortages[43], the sources do not detail specific measures being taken to address the high inflation rate or to reduce the percentage of total household expenditure on food. Humanitarian food agencies and NGOs are also facing a US$230 million shortfall to implement programs until the end of the year[41]. UN Women has transferred US$120 to each of 150 displaced households[43].

**Question:** What additional resources are required to support the increasing number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Port-au-Prince Metropolitan Area?
**Answer:** To support the increasing number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Port-au-Prince Metropolitan Area (ZMPAP), additional resources are required, as humanitarian food assistance is not expected to meet the population's needs[51]. The World Food Programme (WFP) is urgently calling for broad-based support to massively increase lifesaving assistance[53]. Humanitarian food agencies and NGOs in Haiti are short of US$230 million to implement programs[53].

Specific needs include:
*   Increased humanitarian aid, particularly food[58]and healthcare supplies[57].
*   Support to address food inflation, which limits displaced people's access to food[56].
*   Improved access to education for displaced children[56].
*   WASH services, as many lack access to clean water, soap for handwashing, and improved sanitation systems[60].
*   Humanitarian aid for mental health and psychosocial support[59], including psychological support for newly displaced children[59].
*   More health workers to ensure children can access proper care[59].
*   Distribution of shelter kits, kitchen kits, and non-food item (NFI) kits[58].
*   Financial transfers to displaced households[51].

### Urgent Action Required: Addressing Escalating Hunger and Violence Crisis in Haiti

**Question:**  What specific measures are being proposed by the coalition of humanitarian and development agencies, including Action Against Hunger and Save the Children, to address the acute food insecurity crisis in Haiti?
**Answer:** A collective of leading humanitarian and development agencies, including Action Against Hunger, ActionAid, CARE, Mercy Corps, Concern Worldwide, World Vision, and Save the Children, alongside the NGO platform CLIO, is urgently calling on the international community to increase funding, ensure safe and unfettered humanitarian access for aid delivery, and ultimately find sustainable pathways to peace[1][2]. This coalition has called for immediate action to alleviate the escalating hunger crisis[3].

**Question:**  How has the increase in gang violence in Haiti impacted the ability of humanitarian agencies to deliver aid and food supplies to those in need?
**Answer:** The increase in gang violence in Haiti has significantly impacted the ability to deliver aid and food supplies[11][15][18][19][20]. Gang control of major roads blocks food supplies[11], and the violence and security crisis mean that people cannot access and afford food[13][20]. Even when markets have food, violence and inflation have driven prices out of reach for millions[11][20]. Alarming rates of armed gang violence are disrupting daily life[16][17], and this trend is expected to continue, affecting the supply chain[15]. Humanitarian and development agencies are urgently calling for safe and unfettered humanitarian access for aid delivery[13].

**Question:**  What are the key factors contributing to the rise in food prices in Haiti, and how are these affecting the purchasing power of the population?
**Answer:** The key factors contributing to the rise in food prices in Haiti include violence and security crises[22], inflation[22], and gang control of major roads blocking food supplies[21]. These factors have driven prices out of reach for millions[22], meaning people cannot access and afford food[22]. As a result, heads of families are regularly forced to choose whether to feed themselves or their children[21], and women and girls are being forced to offer sex for food[27].

**Question:**  How many people in Haiti are currently classified under IPC Phase 5 Catastrophe, and what are the immediate humanitarian needs of these individuals?
**Answer:** Currently, 6,000 people in Haiti are classified under IPC Phase 5 Catastrophe[31][32][34]. These individuals are experiencing catastrophic levels of hunger and a collapse of their livelihoods[32][34]. They are facing starvation[31], death[35], destitution[31], and extremely critical acute malnutrition levels[33]. Some are internally displaced people living in temporary shelters in Haiti's capital[33], and are at the highest risk of malnutrition and diseases[35]. Women and girls among them are being forced to offer sex for food[35].

### Escalating Armed Gang Violence and Child Recruitment Crisis in ZMPAP Region

**Question:**  What specific challenges have humanitarian responders faced in delivering aid due to the attacks on government infrastructure and public services by armed gangs in Haiti, particularly in the ZMPAP region?
**Answer:** Due to attacks by armed gangs on government infrastructure, prisons, police stations, the airport, and the seaport in the ZMPAP region since March 2024, the work of humanitarian responders has been limited[2]. These attacks have also effectively paralysed the Government[2].

**Question:**  What measures have been taken by the Kenyan contingent deployed in Port-au-Prince to support the Haitian police in regaining control, and what has been the impact of these measures on the security situation?
**Answer:** A Kenyan contingent was deployed to Port-au-Prince in June to support the Haitian police in their attempt to regain control of the capital[11]. Following the deployment of the Kenyan and Jamaican MSS troops, humanitarian responders suggest that the recruitment of minors to armed gangs is increasing[14].

**Question:**  What are the primary factors driving the displacement of populations in Haiti, and how are humanitarian organizations addressing the needs of displaced individuals and communities?
**Answer:** The increasing control of armed gangs, which has led to heightened insecurity and violence, is the main driver of displacement in Haiti[21]. The provided sources do not contain information on how humanitarian organizations are addressing the needs of displaced individuals and communities, only that their work has been limited[24].

**Question:**  How has the increase in forced child recruitment into armed gangs affected the safety and well-being of children in Haiti, and what strategies are being implemented to address this issue?
**Answer:** The increase in forced child recruitment into armed gangs[32]has severely affected the safety, health, and development of children, creating a long-term impact on their future[31]. Children are recruited to reinforce gang ranks and solidify their role and legitimacy within communities[32]. They are used as key informants, collecting information from the national police, Kenyan army, Jamaican army, and other armed groups, and are assigned various small tasks and duties, such as buying groceries[32].

The provided sources do not contain information on specific strategies being implemented to address the issue of forced child recruitment into armed gangs. While a Kenyan contingent was deployed to Port-au-Prince to support the Haitian police in regaining control of the capital[35], and a gang leader signed a peace treaty with the Government[33], the recruitment of minors is suggested to be increasing after the deployment of the Kenyan and Jamaican MSS troops[32], and the implementation of the peace treaty is unclear with violence persisting[33].

### Urgent Action Required: Addressing Child Malnutrition and Violence in Haiti

**Question:**  What are the main factors contributing to the increase in severe acute malnutrition among Haitian children, and what strategies are being implemented to address this crisis?
**Answer:** Severe acute malnutrition among children in Haiti increased by almost 20% between January and July 2024, with nearly 125,000 Haitian children facing severe acute malnutrition in July[1]. This situation is aggravated by escalating violence[1], deep poverty[8], and political instability[4]. Increased food insecurity and malnutrition, a cholera outbreak, and the current hurricane season also compound this situation[6]. Access constraints, such as numerous checkpoints set up by heavily armed gangs, limit the humanitarian response to civilians, including children[8].

To address this crisis, Save the Children is providing cash assistance for displaced families in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince and to host families in the Grand'Anse and South department[3]. The organization is calling for full, unfettered access for aid workers and life-saving supplies across Haiti, especially in Port-au-Prince, to combat hunger and severe acute malnutrition[3]. Save the Children is also calling on the international community to urgently increase humanitarian funding for Haiti[3]. The Security Council is urged to call for the safe and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance to affected populations, including children, and to urge donors to swiftly mobilize additional flexible funds to support the humanitarian response[10].

**Question:**  What are the primary challenges faced by child protection actors in accessing and assisting children affected by armed violence in Haiti, particularly those escaping from armed groups?
**Answer:** Child protection actors in Haiti face several primary challenges in accessing and assisting children affected by armed violence, particularly those escaping armed groups. Access is constrained by numerous checkpoints set up by heavily armed gangs along National Roads 1, 2, and 3 in Port-au-Prince (PAP) and Artibonite, which limits the humanitarian response[11]. Armed groups often do not permit humanitarian assistance, especially in Artibonite and certain areas of PAP[11]. There is a demand for unfettered access for aid workers and life-saving supplies across Haiti, particularly in Port-au-Prince[20]. Additionally, there is limited capacity to assist children escaping armed violence[16], and a need for sufficient child protection capacities[13]. Challenges also include a lack of information on separated and unaccompanied children, their needs, and the conflict's impact on their lives[15][20]. Furthermore, there is a call for the urgent mobilization of resources and increased humanitarian funding for Haiti[14].
