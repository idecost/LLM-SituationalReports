# Israel Palestine

## Summary 
The situation in Gaza is dire, marked by ongoing Israeli military operations, including renewed ground invasions and persistent airstrikes that have repeatedly targeted schools and other shelters for internally displaced persons, causing numerous fatalities, including children and women[98]. Over the past year, the conflict has resulted in more than 41,500 to 50,000 Palestinian deaths and approximately 100,000 injuries in Gaza, with thousands still missing, while 101 hostages remain captive[81]. Nearly 1.9 million people are displaced, facing a severe humanitarian crisis with widespread acute malnutrition among children, intentional blocking of food and medicine, and a devastated healthcare system where only half of hospitals are partially operational and mental health needs have tripled[50]. Infrastructure is extensively damaged, including over 68% of cropland and roads, and a significant number of housing units, contributing to an environmental catastrophe with contaminated water and the re-emergence of polio[6]. The West Bank also experiences escalating violence and damage[73], prompting international calls for an immediate ceasefire, full humanitarian access, and accountability for international law violations[55].

## Cluster Summaries

### Urgent Measures Needed to Protect Civilians and Ensure Aid Delivery in Gaza

Extensive civilian harm is occurring due to explosive weapons in densely populated areas and forced displacement orders, highlighting the urgent need for action to protect civilians from escalating violence and to ensure that humanitarian and aid workers can safely deliver critical support[1]. Despite this pressing need, the sources do not specify how the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is addressing these issues.

In parallel, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) faces logistical challenges, particularly due to restrictions at crossings and the collapse of law and order, which hinder the delivery of agricultural aid into Gaza[11]. FAO is prepared to provide more inputs to Gazan farmers and herders once access, security, and mobility conditions are fully restored[19]. However, the sources do not provide details on how FAO is currently tackling these challenges.

### Severe Humanitarian Crisis for Gaza IDPs Amidst Shelter and Supply Shortages

Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Gaza are enduring severe hardships due to inadequate shelter, food, and sanitation. The sites visited by UNRWA protection monitors reveal dire conditions characterized by worn-out tents and tarpaulins, a lack of mattresses, key non-food items (NFIs), and insufficient food, water, and sanitation[1][2][12]. The approaching adverse weather conditions exacerbate these challenges, with shortages of blankets, shoes, warm clothes, and other winter items expected to increase suffering[2][9]. The limited availability of supplies, including sanitary pads and dignity kits, disproportionately affects women and girls, increasing their vulnerability to disease and risk of gender-based violence (GBV)[2][12][13]. An estimated over 800,000 dignity kits are required, far exceeding the 1,900 distributed by partners[10][15].

The lack of basic necessities significantly impacts IDPs, with a continued spread of skin diseases and an acute lack of medications[6][11]. Food shortages and exorbitantly high prices further strain daily life, with vegetables being 10 times more expensive than before the war, and a kilo of tomatoes reaching nearly 8-10[14][24]. Coping mechanisms include relying on canned food, cooking on a fire despite difficulties in finding firewood, and selflessly sharing limited food supplies[21][27]. Cash shortages hinder the use of Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA), negatively affecting living conditions and increasing the risk of exposure to violence or exploitation for women and girls[5][17][18][26].

Efforts to address these challenges involve UNRWA's protection teams identifying and responding to protection risks and needs in areas like Khan Younis and Deir al Balah[15]. Protection Monitors visit shelters and IDP sites, providing awareness sessions, conducting focus group discussions, monitoring aid distribution, and following up on vulnerable cases[11]. The Site Management Working Group (SMWG) partners have monitored 38 sites hosting approximately 170,875 people[11]. Child Protection partners are collecting data to plan for winterization activities, including procuring psychosocial support kits and winter clothes[16]. The GBV sub-cluster is assessing the potential for cash assistance to address urgent needs of women and girls, while efforts are ongoing to strengthen Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) services for those at risk of GBV[14]. Partners are also working with the Shelter Cluster to develop a referral protocol to mitigate the risk of exploitation of vulnerable cases[14].

Despite these efforts, the capacity to conduct repairs or provide alternative places for families remains limited, preventing practical support for those in damaged buildings beyond awareness-raising[12]. The shortage of tents impacts the ability to expand group-based psychosocial support and provide safe spaces or temporary accommodation for unaccompanied children[1][2][12][13]. In September, only nine trucks of shelter items were received via the Fence Road, highlighting the ongoing logistical challenges[14]. The cluster continues to alert families in damaged buildings of risks through awareness-raising messages[16].

### Forced Displacement and Airstrikes Severely Impact Aid Distribution in Gaza

Forced population movement has severely disrupted the ability of partners to maintain operations and distribute aid to those in need in Gaza. Consequently, the World Food Programme (WFP) will cease distributing food baskets through its general food distributions across Gaza in October due to the critically restricted flow of essential goods[1]. This disruption is compounded by the ongoing Israeli airstrikes, which have recently targeted at least six UN-run schools sheltering displaced Palestinians[11]. The UN has expressed deep concern over the repeated airstrikes on shelters for displaced people in the Strip, as these attacks have become an almost daily occurrence[11][14].

In the last 72 hours alone, at least six schools serving as shelters for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) were struck, resulting in tens of fatalities, including children and women[14][17]. Specifically, two separate Israeli airstrikes early Sunday morning targeted a mosque and the Ibn Rushd School in Al-Zawaida, both of which were sheltering displaced civilians in central Gaza[12][13]. These attacks resulted in the deaths of at least 24 Palestinians, including children, and injured 93 others, with another report indicating 26 fatalities[12]. The impact on the displaced Palestinian population is severe, as families are ordered from one area to another, only to be bombed in the schools and tents where they are told to seek shelter[15].

### Urgent Humanitarian Response Needed for Health Crisis in Gaza Amid Infrastructure Collapse

The dire health situation in Gaza is primarily driven by poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, exacerbated by overcrowding in shelters, which are expected to worsen during the winter months[6]. The lack of clean water and hygiene products has led to outbreaks of diarrhoea and skin diseases[1]. The breakdown of sanitation infrastructure has resulted in a proliferation of disease vectors[2], while the collapse of waste management systems, including hazardous medical waste, contributes to contamination[5]. Accumulated waste attracts vermin and insects, further spreading pathogens[10]. The inability to maintain a minimal level of hygiene severely impacts health, and without access to soap, water, or toilets in these crowded conditions, the risk of epidemics is skyrocketing[5][7].

The situation is further compounded by the impact of Israeli air strikes, which have severely affected safety and living conditions in Gaza. No area has been spared, as the strikes have damaged over 370,000 housing units, completely destroying 79,000 homes[12]. Approximately 68% of cropland and roads have also been severely damaged, leading to overcrowding and appalling sanitary conditions[12][17]. Food scarcity, coupled with the lack of clean water and hygiene products, continues to cause outbreaks of diarrhoea and skin diseases[11]. As of September 2024, only 17 of 36 hospitals remain partially functional, struggling with a lack of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water due to the ongoing Israeli attacks[12]. These conditions highlight the urgent need for improved infrastructure and humanitarian aid to prevent further deterioration of health and living standards in Gaza.

### Impact of Gaza Conflict on Maternity Care and Civilian Well-being

The ongoing conflict in Gaza has had a devastating impact on maternity care, leading to a rise in miscarriages, obstetric complications, low birth weight, and premature births. These issues are primarily attributed to stress, malnutrition, and a near-total lack of maternity care[1]. Ala'a, a pregnant woman, experienced these challenges firsthand. At seven months pregnant, she was forced to leave her home and live in a tent[10]. Despite her desire to give birth at home, she had to deliver her baby outside her home after experiencing early labor and enduring four days of labor[1][10]. She was informed that a natural birth was too dangerous[7]. Ultimately, Ala'a delivered her baby, Mohammad, in a field hospital in Khan Younis, which featured a specialized maternity unit supported by UK-Med and the UN agency for sexual and reproductive health, UNFPA[7][10].

Despite the ongoing war and a lack of clean water, food, or security, Ala'a and her newborn Mohammad recovered well[7]. She described the health staff as tireless[10] and a "great team"[1], noting they smiled even under pressure[7]. Ala'a considered it the "best decision" to give birth there[7] and expressed gratitude to the hospital staff[8]. However, it is noted that continuous support for health services is impossible without a ceasefire, full access, and sustained funding[8]. Ala'a also endured multiple evacuations and fled under fire[1].

The conflict has also profoundly impacted individuals like Taleen Al-Hinnawi and Nada Al-Gharib. Taleen Al-Hinnawi lost her father due to the war and is adjusting to her new life in the Al-Baraka orphanage camp[11]. She shows signs of shock and sadness[11], describing her father as "very affectionate" and stating, "I don't feel like Baba was martyred"[11]. She and her mother found a "second home" in the Al-Baraka orphanage camp after fleeing Rafah and passing through Israeli checkpoints[11]. In the camp, everyone shares similar stories and pain, fostering a sense of community where they are "like siblings" and "all mothers are like our mothers"[11].

Nada Al-Gharib also suffered significant losses, losing her father and her only brother due to the war[12]. She and her mother were injured in a strike on their tent in Khan Younis, where they were trapped for three days[13]. Her family had been displaced from northern Gaza to Khan Younis because "the occupation demanded of us"[13]. After leaving the tent, Nada and her mother went to the industrial area west of Khan Younis for treatment and were trapped again[13]. Nada described her father as a great, kind man who loved his family[18]. Despite the hardships and loss, she stated, "We love our lives. Even though it's hard and the loss of our loved ones is hard for us, we try to live for them"[18].

In the context of maternity care, UK-Med runs a field hospital in Khan Younis that includes a specialized maternity unit[21]. This unit is supported by UK-Med, the United Kingdom, and UNFPA[21]. UNFPA provides the hospital's maternity unit with reproductive health kits and supplies[22] and ensures staff can offer comprehensive care, including for obstetric emergencies[22]. Ala'a visited this field hospital for a check-up[21] and later delivered her baby there[22], stating it was the best decision to come there to give birth[22] and expressing gratitude to the staff[27].

### Emergency Response Challenges Amid Israeli Blockade and Strikes in Gaza Strip

Ambulances and emergency responders quickly arrived at the scene to assist the victims, with paramedics searching the rubble inside a blasted-out coffee shop and gathering human remains into small boxes[1][2]. However, the challenges faced by emergency responders in the West Bank remain unclear. The Civil Defense first responders, operating under the Hamas-run government, reported that they were unable to reach several hit homes and buildings due to the ongoing bombardment[11].

The Israeli military's Operation Iron Swords has imposed a complete blockade of the Gaza Strip[21]. This has led to dire consequences for the civilian population, with the enclave's health ministry reporting a death toll exceeding 41,800 since October 7[21]. Other reports indicate over 41,500 killed and almost 100,000 wounded from nearly a year of relentless Israeli attacks[22], with the death toll nearing 42,000 according to the Palestinian Health Ministry[21]. Thousands are also reported missing under the rubble of destroyed buildings[26].

Heavy Israeli strikes have been reported across northern Gaza, with dozens of explosions from air strikes and tank shelling shaking the ground and buildings[23]. Several homes and buildings have been hit, and first responders were unable to reach them due to the bombardment[26]. Strikes have also been reported in Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, where roads have been closed[28], and the Jabalia refugee camp has been surrounded[28].

The Israeli army has dropped leaflets ordering people to flee their homes[23] and issued evacuation orders[21], causing people to leave without knowing where to go or having means of transportation[21]. Strikes have targeted shelters, including a mosque and a school, killing people who were sheltering there[21]. Children are suffering, and hunger is spreading and deepening due to the scarcity of basic supplies[28]. Residents have been ordered to move to the humanitarian zone in southern Gaza[21], but some are unwilling due to perceived dangers and reports of the army shooting at people there[21].

### UN Urges Israel to Investigate Human Rights Violations Transparently and Independently

The UN Human Rights office emphasizes the necessity for Israel to conduct a thorough, prompt, independent, and transparent investigation into incidents, ensuring that perpetrators of violations are held accountable, in accordance with international human rights law[1][2][3].

### UN Urges Palestinian Armed Groups to Cease Using Civilians as Shields

The UN Human Rights Office emphasizes that Palestinian armed group members must not use civilians as shields to protect themselves from attacks, as this practice violates international humanitarian law (IHL)[1]. Furthermore, these groups are urged to stop such actions immediately and to take all feasible precautions to safeguard civilians under their control from the impacts of hostilities[1].

### Comprehensive Humanitarian Response Amidst Severe Infrastructure Damage in Gaza Conflict

Efforts to support displaced people in Gaza shelters have been extensive, focusing on providing essential food and water supplies. Displaced individuals have received hot meals, food packs, vegetables, and vouchers, while clean water and nutritional supplements have been distributed to those in need[1]. Over 40 million hot meals have been prepared and distributed to displaced families, and water is supplied to 110,000 people daily[1][2]. Nutritional supplements are specifically provided to 35,000 pregnant women and young children every two weeks[2]. Additionally, a Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition program has been initiated, delivering 1,700 cartons of Ready to Use Therapeutic Food to northern Gaza[6]. MSF teams have also contributed by distributing water[1].

The ongoing conflict has exacerbated mental health concerns in Gaza, where over 485,000 people had already been diagnosed with mental disorders before the war[12]. Humanitarian teams are actively addressing these issues by caring for patients with mental health conditions[16] and conducting psychosocial support sessions for over 94,000 children[17]. Mental health services are being offered to help alleviate the psychological impact of the conflict[12].

The destruction of homes and infrastructure has severely disrupted the daily lives of Gaza residents[21]. An Islamic Relief staff member reported that their home is damaged and uninhabitable, with their siblings and colleagues also losing their homes[21]. The staff member further noted the loss of their Islamic Relief office, children's schools, a mosque, a hospital, restaurants, and a church, emphasizing that their lives are being systematically destroyed[21]. The extent of the destruction is so profound that returning home is not feasible, even if the conflict ends[21].

Civilian infrastructure, including schools, religious buildings, hospitals, and bakeries, has been decimated[22]. The healthcare system has been systematically dismantled, with most primary healthcare centers non-operational[23][26]. Critical services such as oncology, MRI, specialized pediatric surgery, and endocrinology are no longer available[24]. The absence of electricity, except for limited generator use hindered by high fuel costs, has led to a drastic reduction in access to essential services like water, food, and education, described as a "real shock"[28]. This situation has also resulted in a rise in infectious diseases, including gastroenteritis from polluted water, skin infections, and hepatitis A[26].

### WHO Urges Ceasefire and Protection of Healthcare in Conflict Zones

The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a call for the de-escalation of the ongoing conflict, emphasizing the need for healthcare to be protected and not targeted during hostilities. They stress the importance of securing access routes to ensure the delivery of essential supplies. In addition to these measures, WHO advocates for a ceasefire and a political solution to achieve lasting peace. Tedros, representing WHO, poignantly stated that "The best medicine is peace" to underline the organization's commitment to these goals[1].

### Escalating Humanitarian Crisis in Israel-Gaza: Urgent Need for Ceasefire and Aid

The ongoing conflict has resulted in a widespread collective trauma in Israel, with the demand for mental health care doubling and, in some areas, tripling at a rapid pace[2]. Despite this increased need, specific resources available in Israel to address this demand remain unspecified. The international community's response to the conflict has been mixed, with calls for a ceasefire yet to result in a sustained agreement[19]. Various organizations continue to advocate for an immediate and lasting ceasefire[13], but efforts have been hindered by the failure of Israel, Hamas, and their allies to reach a deal[18]. While Israel's allies publicly emphasize the importance of a ceasefire, they continue to provide military support[17]. The United States, despite recent calls for a ceasefire, has been criticized for obstructing ceasefire efforts at the United Nations Security Council and for continuing arms sales to Israel[19]. Consequently, a ceasefire remains elusive[12].

The conflict has also raised significant concerns regarding accountability for violations of international humanitarian law. There are calls for perpetrators to be held accountable for serious violations[14], yet the past year has been characterized by "shameful inaction"[20]. Concerns persist that Israel operates with a "free pass for impunity" and blocks aid "with impunity as the world watches"[12][15]. International governments are urged to leverage their influence to halt attacks on civilians and violations of international law, including ending arms sales that perpetuate the violence[12]. The international community is also called to act decisively to end what is described as Israel's "crime of genocide"[11], with the US bearing responsibility to ensure its support does not harm civilians[19].

Israeli military operations in Gaza have had devastating effects on the civilian population, resulting in over 41,500 deaths, including mass casualties among children[21][26]. Specifically, 118 children and young people who were under care have been killed since the crisis began[21]. Additionally, 765 deaths have occurred due to at least 516 attacks on healthcare facilities in Gaza since October 2023[21]. The international community is urged to stop the indiscriminate killing of civilians and address the direct killing of Palestinian people[21][22].

The conflict has also left over 96,000 people wounded[21]. Medical staff are treating patients daily for severe injuries from bombings, such as extensive burns, crushed bones, and amputations[30]. Palestinians in Gaza are suffering from war wounds, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and mental trauma, with at least 12,000 people in urgent need of medical evacuation[25][30]. The civilian population has been repeatedly displaced, forced into increasingly smaller areas under bombardment[23]. Nearly everyone is displaced, living in overcrowded and inhumane conditions[21][23][30].

As of September 25, the ground operation in the Gaza Strip has resulted in 346 reported fatalities and 2,290 injuries among Israeli soldiers[31].

### Escalating Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza and West Bank: Urgent Action Required

Military operations in the West Bank have caused significant damage to civilian infrastructure, including the forced demolition of over 2,000 Palestinian homes and extensive damage to public infrastructure such as roads, leading to widespread destruction[1]. These operations, coupled with increased violence, movement restrictions, and economic disruption, severely impact daily life and contribute to extreme mental distress and increased mental health concerns among the West Bank population, resulting in forced displacement[1][2].

In Gaza, women face a double burden, often becoming heads of their households and navigating survival amidst destruction[11]. Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers experience immense difficulties due to the collapse of healthcare services[11]. Women also take on tasks traditionally done by men, such as fetching water, due to the loss of male family members[14].

Children in Gaza are experiencing profound trauma, grappling with anxiety and severe physical injuries, with many having lost limbs[14][16]. They have missed an entire year of education, and schools sheltering displaced families have been repeatedly shelled[13][14]. Over five times more children were killed in Gaza in the last year than between 2005 and 2022 combined, with UNICEF stating that children are dying at an alarming rate[14][19]. Approximately 17,000 children are unaccompanied or separated, and 625,000 children have been out of school for a whole year[13][14].

The conflict has had a devastating impact on both women and children, with more than 41,000 people killed and 96,000 injured[11]. The destruction of Gaza's infrastructure has been catastrophic, with around 68% of cropland and roads either destroyed or severely damaged[12][19]. Only 17 of 36 hospitals remain partially functional, all suffering from a lack of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water[12]. Humanitarian aid movement in Gaza remains "very dangerous"[15]. The illegal blockade, deliberate isolation of Gaza, systematic deprivation of basic human rights, and deliberate destruction of essential services are long-standing crimes, with thousands of bodies still under rubble and in the streets, unreachable by rescue and medical teams[20]. Israel is also intentionally blocking deliveries of food and medicine[14].

Humanitarian organizations are addressing these challenges in several ways. Oxfam partner Juzoor is supporting hundreds of thousands of people in over 90 shelters and health points across Gaza[11][27]. UNICEF has vaccinated thousands of children for polio in the area[11]. Oxfam is calling for an immediate, permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages and unlawfully detained Palestinians, and an end to all lethal arms sales to Israel[16][25]. Oxfam also demands full humanitarian access to Gaza and urges the international community to enforce accountability by addressing the illegal Israeli occupation, removing settlements in the occupied West Bank, and providing reparations to affected Palestinian communities[16].

As of February 2024, 745,000 people are facing emergency levels of food insecurity, and 495,000 people are facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity[21]. There is a deliberate attempt to starve Gaza's population, with Israel reportedly intentionally blocking deliveries of food and medicine, contributing to indirect deaths due to starvation[28][30]. Moving humanitarian aid in Gaza remains "very dangerous," and aid convoys have been "continually blocked and even shot at"[23][29]. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) reported that Israel was intentionally blocking deliveries of food and medicine to Gaza[30]. UNICEF's director expressed confidence in meeting the needs but noted it requires a "tremendous amount of effort"[29].

### Urgent Sanctions Needed: Addressing Dehumanization and Healthcare Crisis in Lebanon

Signatory organizations have expressed deep concern over the ongoing dehumanization of Lebanese civilians, highlighting the distressing impact on health workers who have been among the victims of bombings[1]. These organizations have called on governments to take action by imposing sanctions, such as an arms embargo on Israel, in response to its gross violations of international law[1]. Despite these calls, many commentators and public figures have either remained silent or offered only superficial expressions of concern, even as their countries continue to be complicit through ongoing arms sales[4]. Reports indicate that at least 885 healthcare workers have been killed, and there have been instances where women have undergone caesarians and children have had amputations without anaesthetics, underscoring the severe humanitarian crisis[2].

### Israeli Offensive in Jabaliya Escalates Humanitarian Crisis and Food Scarcity in Gaza

Israeli forces have initiated a new air and ground offensive in Jabaliya, located in northern Gaza, encircling the area and targeting militant sites with warplanes[1]. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have launched a military operation in the Jabaliya refugee camp, focusing on dismantling Hamas infrastructure by striking several facilities, including weapons depots and underground infrastructure[3]. This operation aims to systematically dismantle terrorist infrastructure and will continue as long as necessary, according to the IDF[3].

Jabaliya, home to a densely populated refugee camp, is experiencing severe implications due to these military actions[1]. Israel has called for the complete evacuation of northern Gaza, where approximately 300,000 people remain despite earlier warnings[1]. The conflict has resulted in tragic casualties, including an airstrike on a home in Jabaliya that killed a dozen family members, including parents, and wounded a Health Ministry medic[4]. Additionally, a local journalist was killed in artillery shelling on his home[4].

The offensive has also led to the destruction of over 500 dunums of newly replanted agricultural land, including crops like eggplants, which were intended to sustain the local population[6]. This destruction is part of a broader strategy to prevent the Palestinian people from relying on the region's agricultural resources, contributing to a severe famine[6]. As a result, many people in northern Gaza are forced to eat tree leaves and bake ground-up animal feed instead of flour, highlighting the dire food scarcity[6]. The population is subjected to an arbitrary siege and systematic starvation by Israel[6].

The conflict has severely impacted the availability of essential services and resources in Gaza, with hundreds of thousands lacking access to basic necessities like food and clean water[17][19]. The destruction of agricultural land and civilian infrastructure, including a road built by the Israeli military that split Gaza, has further limited access to food[13]. Ongoing bombardments and fuel shortages have forced bakeries to shut down, restricting access to bread[14]. Markets in Gaza City and across northern Gaza face an almost total absence of fresh vegetables, fruit, and protein sources like poultry and meat[13]. Israel's systematic destruction of Gaza's food basket and blockade of food and humanitarian aid have resulted in widespread famine[12].

Agricultural lands along the "security fence" have been bulldozed or destroyed, removing approximately 96 square kilometers[14]. An Israeli "buffer" road and zone, along with the Netzarim axis, have destroyed about three square kilometers of agricultural lands, affecting the majority of agricultural land in the Gaza Strip, including hundreds of farms for vegetables, fruits, poultry, and livestock[14]. Additional land, at least 34 square kilometers, has been destroyed by Israeli incursions or bombardment outside this "buffer zone"[13]. The lack of electricity, destruction of water wells, and scarcity of fuel make it difficult to cultivate new areas and irrigate them[13]. Crops that people in northern Gaza depended on have been bulldozed, exacerbated by Israel's restrictions on the entry of fruits and vegetables into northern Gazan markets[19].

Water resources have also been severely affected, with the contamination of soil and water resources potentially persisting for years, hampering access to safe drinking water[14]. Intensive bombardment has damaged water infrastructure, leading to the mixing of sewage and potable water supplies[13]. The destruction of water wells further complicates irrigation efforts[13]. The approaching rainy season is expected to worsen living conditions, putting hundreds of thousands at heightened risk of health hazards and limited access to essential services[17]. The UN and humanitarian partners have developed a Winterization Plan to address critical needs, including for over 850,000 people in flood-prone areas[19]. However, planned interventions to improve conditions in shelters, distribute materials, and install temporary drainage systems are hindered by the lack of unimpeded entry of humanitarian items, availability of fuel, and facilitation of safe humanitarian movement[15].
