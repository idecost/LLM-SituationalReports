# Cyclone Remal-Week 21 2024 

## Summary 
Bangladesh is currently facing the severe threat of Cyclone Remal, which was expected to make landfall by midnight on May 26th, 2024, near Sagar Island, India and Khepupara, Bangladesh, with maximum wind speeds of 110-120 km/hr and gusts up to 135 km/hr[48][70]. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department has issued Great Danger Signal No. 10 for coastal districts like Mongla, Payra, Khulna, Satkhira, Barguna, Patuakhali, and Bhola, warning of potential floods, flash floods, landslides, and a storm surge up to 12 feet[72][74]. This storm threatens an exposed population of 11 million people[70], including 1.3 million vulnerable individuals[34], and exacerbates existing challenges for coastal communities, many of whom are still recovering from recent heatwaves and fires[77]. The situation is further complicated by a recent fire in B3 Camp-13, which displaced 4,000 people who now require shelter, food, and water as the cyclone approaches[73]. In response, nearly a million people are fleeing inland to concrete storm shelters[67], with 4,000 cyclone shelters prepared for evacuation[11], and organizations like the World Food Programme (WFP) have dispatched anticipatory cash assistance to over 30,000 at-risk families (150,000 people) in Khulna and Barishal Divisions to aid in preparation and recovery[63]. World Vision Bangladesh is also mobilizing to assist fire survivors and prepare for the storm's impact, prioritizing the safety and well-being of affected children and communities[73].

## Cluster Summaries

### UN Peacekeeping Engages Bangladesh on Alleged Human Rights Violations by Rab

The UN Peacekeeping has consistently engaged in bilateral discussions with national authorities to address serious allegations of human rights violations by defense and security forces in Bangladesh, with a particular focus on the actions of members of Rab[1].

### Urgent Action Required: Addressing Climate and Health Crises in Rohingya Camps

Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, are facing severe challenges due to extreme weather events and escalating climate-related threats, including cyclones, landslides, and floods[1][2][3][4]. The refugees endure inhumane living conditions with no investment in their living conditions or education, leading to a dire and deteriorating situation[11][14]. These conditions make them particularly vulnerable to climate-induced hazards, which not only threaten their safety but also lead to internal displacement[11][16]. Additionally, fires have occurred in the camps, such as when an LPG gas canister exploded in a hut, further exacerbating the precarious living conditions[12][14].

Health issues are rampant in the camps, with outbreaks of diseases like diphtheria, cholera, measles, COVID-19, scabies, and dengue[12]. Skin diseases, including eczema and scabies, are spreading rapidly due to waste accumulation around the camps[18]. This public health crisis is compounded by the lack of clean water, as the water treatment plant on the outskirts of Khulna, once a "beacon of hope," has been abandoned due to high costs and internal politics, leaving residents without a reliable source of fresh water[21][23][26]. Consequently, people in areas like Notun Bazar are forced to use saline water for cooking, drinking, and bathing, which poses a major health hazard[23][24][31][33][34].

The increasing salinisation of freshwater resources in Khulna is a significant threat to public health, with research indicating that drinking-water sodium and urinary sodium are linked to increased protein excretion, a marker for kidney disease[32][40][49]. Among trial participants, elevated levels of protein in urine were observed, highlighting the risk of kidney-related diseases if water quality does not improve[32][42][48][54]. Khatun, a resident diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD), exemplifies the severe health impacts of this crisis. Her condition, characterized by swollen hands and feet, high blood pressure, fatigue, and shortness of breath, has deteriorated over nearly seven years, affecting her heart, lungs, and central nervous system[34][36][37][38]. She requires immediate dialysis up to three times a week[35][36].

In addition to water salinity, extreme heat in Khulna has led to a rise in hospital admissions, with patients occupying corridors and stairways due to a lack of beds[41]. High temperatures cause profound sweating, loss of body fluid, and dehydration, affecting both men and women in tropical regions[41][44][49]. The combined effects of water salinity and extreme heat are putting the health of local populations under greater threat, underscoring the urgent need for improvements in water quality and infrastructure to mitigate these deadly consequences[41][44][51][53][56].

### Fishing Operations Suspended Due to Cyclone Remal Safety Concerns

To ensure the safety of fishermen during Cyclone Remal, there is a total suspension of fishing operations[6]. Fishermen are advised not to venture into the central Bay of Bengal until May 26th, and into the North Bay of Bengal until May 27th[1][2][3]. Additionally, they are advised to avoid the south Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea until May 27th, and the North Bay of Bengal from May 25th to May 27th[2][3].

### Cyclone Remal: Strengthening Healthcare and Shelter Response in Khulna, Bangladesh

In response to the public health challenges posed by Cyclone Remal in Khulna, Bangladesh, several measures have been implemented to bolster the healthcare system's capacity. Emergency medical teams have been formed and are ready to respond across all districts, with a specific focus on the coastal districts of Bagerhat, Khulna, and Satkhira, where 359 medical teams have been established[8][10][31]. Civil Surgeons in these areas have been instructed to ensure that adequate medicines and logistics are prepositioned in hospitals to address the needs arising from the cyclone[10][31][41].

To further support these efforts, an adequate number of water purification tablets (WPT), IV saline, Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS), and first aid kits, including anti-snake venoms, have been prepositioned at all levels of the healthcare system[10][41][51]. This comprehensive preparation aims to mitigate the health risks associated with the cyclone's impact.

Additionally, 706 Government Primary Schools (GPSs) have been identified and converted into cyclone shelters to accommodate families at risk, providing them with a safe refuge during the cyclone[10][51]. These measures reflect a coordinated effort to ensure the safety and well-being of the affected populations in the face of Cyclone Remal.

### Cyclone Remal Threatens Bangladesh: Urgent Measures and Community Mobilization

The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) has implemented several measures in anticipation of Cyclone Remal, which is expected to intensify from a depression in the Bay of Bengal into a severe cyclone. The cyclone is projected to make landfall between Kolkata, India, and Patuakhali, Bangladesh, from midnight on May 26 to the early morning of May 27, 2024[1][2]. In response, the BMD has issued Danger Signal 10 for the coastal districts of Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Pirojpur, Jhalokathi, Barguna, Barishal, Bhola, Patuakhali, and their offshore islands and chars[1][2]. Azizur Rahman, Director of the BMD, reported that Cyclone Remal had begun crossing the Bangladesh coast and could continue affecting the area until at least the early hours of Monday morning, with maximum wind speeds recorded at 90 kilometers per hour and potentially increasing[5][7].

The cyclone is expected to bring maximum wind speeds of 100-110 km/h during its peak impact, with some forecasts predicting winds of 110-120 kilometers per hour and gusts up to 135 kilometers per hour[1][2][3]. Heavy rainfall is anticipated, posing risks of floods, flash floods, and landslides[1][2]. The cyclone could also generate a storm surge of up to 12 feet (four meters) above normal astronomical tide, which is particularly dangerous for Bangladesh's low-lying coastal areas[5][8][10]. These areas, including Satkhira, Khulna, Bagerhat, Pirojpur, Jhalokathi, Barguna, Bhola, Patuakhali, Barishal, Noakhali, Lakshmipur, Feni, Cumilla, Chattogram, and Cox's Bazar, face a critical threat of inundation from a wind-driven surge of 3-5 feet above normal astronomical tide[1][2][10]. The storm is expected to bring heavy to very heavy rainfall and strong winds to these coastal regions[2][10].

World Vision Bangladesh (WVB) is actively responding to the cyclone by scaling up its efforts to support vulnerable children and communities[11]. Their teams are on high alert, prioritizing safety and providing critical support to coastal communities, children, and families[11]. Local mobilization is central to their preparedness and anticipatory action, with over 1,400 community-based groups involved in these efforts[21][24][29]. Nearly 3,000 WVB volunteers are disseminating early warning messages to ensure residents are aware of potential dangers and necessary actions, while 10,000 youth forum and child forum members are being informed and prepared to take action[29]. Awareness campaigns are ongoing across all coastal project locations to promote critical knowledge for families to protect themselves and their belongings[29].

WVB has prepositioned essential relief materials, including dry food supplies, and strategically positioned trained staff and logistical equipment for rapid deployment[13]. Their BRCR team is prepared to support Rohingya camps and host communities in affected areas[13]. Emergency Operation Centers have been activated in each field location to facilitate a rapid response, with the WV Bangladesh National Disaster Management Team and Regional Field Disaster Management Teams on high alert for immediate deployment[17]. WVB is coordinating with other NGOs, UN agencies, and government bodies to ensure a comprehensive response that prioritizes the needs of affected children and communities[17][18]. They have also formed a rapid assessment team to evaluate the damage and immediate needs[18], and their Child Protection Team has provided foster care services and reunified three missing children with their families[14].

The Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG), a platform for government and non-government humanitarian agencies under the Humanitarian Coordination Task Team (HCTT), has conducted an impact analysis of Cyclone Remal[31][33][34]. NAWG compiles and interpolates information from sources such as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and BMD for its reports, which are intended for internal use by NAWG Bangladesh Members for preparatory activities and are not official government information[35][37][38]. Their analysis indicates that up to 1.9 million people are at risk, with an exposed population of 11 million in areas expected to experience wind speeds of 110-120 km/h[31][41]. Projected maximum wind speeds are 55-56 km/h gusting to 65 km/h on May 25, 110-120 km/h gusting to 130 km/h on May 26, and 50-60 km/h gusting to 70 km/h on May 27[33].

### Sustained Community Improvements in Hygiene Practices and Infrastructure Development

Preventive measures taken by households increased from a baseline of 49 to an endline of 59, and latrine conditions improved from a baseline of 22 to an endline of 48.8, indicating a lasting shift in community practices and infrastructure[41]. To ensure the long-term sustainability of these improvements, ongoing engagement, resource mobilization, and the integration of feedback mechanisms are necessary to adapt and respond to emerging needs and challenges[41]. However, it is important to note that the provided sources do not attribute these improvements to Cyclone Remal.

### UNICEF and WFP Mobilize Rapid Response for Cyclone Preparedness in Bangladesh

UNICEF has established three contingency partnerships with civil society organizations (CSOs) that are ready to be activated for a rapid response in cyclone-affected areas, and an additional 19 partnerships can be reprogrammed for emergency response if needed[1][2]. In Bangladesh, the Government has issued cyclone signal number 10, which is a severe warning as it is just one level below the maximum signal of 11, indicating the intensity of the storm[21].

In response to such extreme weather events, the World Food Programme (WFP) has implemented its Anticipatory Action (AA) programme, which aims to prevent and mitigate the effects of extreme weather on the food security and nutrition of highly vulnerable populations[41][42]. This programme facilitates the implementation and financing of actions before an extreme weather event occurs, providing forecast-based cash assistance to help families prepare for and recover from impending storms[41][42][46][48]. With this cash assistance, families can procure essential items such as food, medicines, and cattle feed, reinforce their homes with ropes, and arrange transportation to safer locations[31][32][33][36][45][48]. The cash distribution is supported by early warning messages and evacuation assistance, coordinated with local government authorities[46].

In Bangladesh, WFP collaborates with national and local government partners to develop early-warning systems and anticipatory actions for critical natural hazards, including floods, cyclones, flash floods, and heavy rainfall[42]. As part of these initiatives, WFP finalizes beneficiary databases for flood-prone areas in the northeast and cyclone-prone areas in the southwestern regions[43]. To ensure efficiency and avoid duplication, WFP coordinates closely with partners to verify beneficiary databases[49]. Additionally, WFP participates in Disaster Management Committee (DMC) meetings to ensure a coordinated approach to preparedness and response, and its cooperating partners assist Cyclone Shelter Management Committees (SMCs)[49]. WFP's camp retailer partners maintain emergency stocks of food for rapid response, and efforts are made to mitigate transport and telecommunications disruptions[49].

### Global Humanitarian Funding Crisis: Urgent Need for Flexible Funding Solutions

The Needs and Population Monitoring (NPM) report highlights that receiving more tickets in a site or sector does not necessarily indicate greater needs; it may instead reflect more Community Feedback Mechanism (CFM) coverage, trust in the system, or a larger population in that area[1]. However, this interpretation is not directly linked to Cyclone Remal in Bangladesh.

The global humanitarian funding crisis is marked by a lack of quick solutions[11] and a significant funding shortfall[14], creating a "crisis within a crisis"[14]. This shortfall has resulted in humanitarian organizations failing to meet their targets in 2023, reaching less than two-thirds of the people they intended to support[11]. Consequently, response plans for 2024 are ultra-prioritized with extremely tightened budgets[11]. The challenges faced include a widening gap between needs and response, exacerbated by conflicts, climate emergencies, and collapsing economies, leading to catastrophic hunger, massive displacement, and disease outbreaks[12]. The inability to deliver life-saving aid and essential services due to inadequate resources perpetuates cycles of suffering and worsens existing emergencies[13]. Sole reliance on humanitarian efforts is insufficient in the long term[12]. There is a pressing need for more flexible funding mechanisms, such as multi-year funding and reduced restrictions on fund allocation, to enhance the effectiveness of support[15]. However, the sources do not specify how these challenges impact the response to Cyclone Remal in Bangladesh.

Coordination with the Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) and local government was a key action in evacuating at-risk communities in preparation for an impending cyclone[21]. The Grand Bargain, an agreement on humanitarian reform, underscores that localization is crucial for preventing conflicts and reducing vulnerability[31]. It emphasizes the importance of collaborating closely with local actors to empower them rather than replace them, which is vital for reducing vulnerability and enhancing local capacity[31]. While actions such as distributing cash assistance digitally to vulnerable households for preparation, disseminating early warning messages, and coordinating with local government for evacuation are described[32], the sources do not specifically name the cyclone as "Remal" or mention "Bangladesh" in relation to the Grand Bargain.

### Enhancing Cyclone Preparedness: Addressing Gaps in Early Warning Systems

Current gaps in early warning systems have significant implications for cyclone preparedness, particularly in regions like Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries where these systems are often lacking[4]. Accurate forecasts and useful early warnings for cyclones require comprehensive data from all countries in a region to be integrated into weather models[1]. However, a significant data gap exists because weather data from exclusive economic zones is currently unavailable[1]. Cyclones forming from the lower to middle troposphere are especially challenging to predict due to their lack of organization and weaker winds in the middle troposphere[1][21]. In contrast, stronger winds in the upper troposphere stabilize the cyclone's structure[21].

These gaps in early warning systems mean that people cannot evacuate before a hazard hits, preventing temporary reduction of their exposure[3][9]. Increasing the coverage of these systems would help mitigate this exposure[3]. The absence of effective early warning systems contributes to higher vulnerability in lower-income countries[8], where people are less protected[3] and populations cannot adequately prepare for storms[2].

To reduce the vulnerability of low-income households to cyclones and other climate-related disasters, several measures can be implemented. Poverty reduction is crucial, as lifting people out of poverty reduces climate risks[14]. This requires international cooperation and support to ensure the poorest and most vulnerable are not left behind[14]. Investing in infrastructure, such as better buildings and strict building standards, is vital[14][16][17]. Providing access to basic resources like electricity, clean water, and temperature control systems is also essential[12][18].

Enhancing early warning systems is another critical measure. Increasing their coverage helps reduce exposure, allowing people to evacuate before hazards strike[17]. Accurate forecasts depend on data integration from all countries in a region[20]. Improving agricultural productivity is important, as more productive systems can recover more effectively from damaging events[16][17]. Financial resilience is necessary, ensuring households have the means to absorb shocks in energy or food prices and recover after disasters[12].

Strong governance and support are vital, with political systems facilitating national and international aid before or after hazards[16][18]. Populations advocating for political rights and accountability also play a role[19]. Finally, disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies can enhance human capital investment, including providing educational opportunities for households constrained by subsistence consumption[11].

### Cyclone Remal Response: WFP Distributes Biscuits to Rohingya Refugees

In response to the significant threat posed by Cyclone Remal to nearly 1 million Rohingya people residing in the world's largest refugee camp, the World Food Programme (WFP) has taken proactive measures by distributing fortified biscuits to 3,400 Rohingya refugees. This initiative is part of a broader effort to address immediate nutritional needs while ongoing assessments are conducted to evaluate and update the extent of potential damage caused by the cyclone[2][3]. 

In parallel, the Common Feedback Platform (CFP) plays a crucial role in enhancing Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) and informing programming within the Rohingya response in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. The CFP, a collaborative inter-agency report, provides a comprehensive overview of community feedback gathered through the response efforts[11]. This feedback is collected via Complaints and Feedback Mechanisms (CFMs), which allow affected communities to voice their challenges concerning programs, services, and the overall humanitarian response[11]. The data, anonymized and sourced from various organizations, is consolidated on a monthly basis to produce these insightful reports[11].
