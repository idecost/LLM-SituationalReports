# LandslideFloods-Week 31 2024 

## Summary 
India is grappling with severe natural calamities, primarily devastating landslides and heavy rainfall in Kerala's Wayanad district since the early hours of July 30th, alongside heavy rains impacting Delhi and the National Capital Region on August 1st[49]. In Wayanad, devastating landslides have resulted in at least 358 deaths and over 200 missing persons as of August 3rd, with earlier reports indicating 270 lives claimed and 378 missing by July 31st[92]. Thousands have been displaced, with over 11,000 individuals housed in 106 relief camps across Kerala[52]. The disaster has destroyed critical infrastructure, including a main bridge and hundreds of buildings, isolating many families and causing power outages[69]. Rescue operations are actively underway, involving the KSDMA, NDRF, army, police, and volunteers, utilizing helicopters, drones, and sniffer dogs, though efforts are challenged by continued heavy rains and blocked roads[34]. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued red alerts for extremely heavy rainfall in several Kerala districts, forecasting continued heavy showers[49]. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed distress and announced compensation for victims' families, while the Kerala government declared a state of mourning[1][57]. Experts attribute the increased frequency of such events to erratic monsoon patterns, climate change, and rapid, ecologically insensitive construction in the Western Ghats, emphasizing the urgent need for comprehensive action plans and improved early warning systems[42].

## Cluster Summaries

### Kerala Disaster Response: Relief Efforts and Coordination Challenges Identified

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured the Kerala government of "all possible help" in response to the current situation[1]. In the affected district, more than 3,000 people have been accommodated in 45 relief camps, where volunteers have mobilized resources to provide cooked food and rations[12][14][17]. These volunteers, including members of the WhiteGuard Volunteer Group and the Kerala Suchitwa Mission, are also assisting the injured with hospital needs and coordinating hospital efforts[14][21][31]. The WhiteGuard Volunteer Group, consisting of 300 community members, arrived on site within two hours of the disaster's onset. While trained members are primarily engaged in search and rescue efforts, others focus on food support, hospital coordination, and arranging freezers to preserve bodies[31]. The Kerala Suchitwa Mission is also working on waste management and managing the burial of deceased individuals[31].

The Kerala Association of Professional Social Workers (KAPS) is providing emergency psychosocial first aid to affected communities, with a special focus on children[16][26]. Some individuals have taken injured people to safety, further supporting the community's needs[25]. Despite these efforts, the sources do not provide information on how the relief camps are managed to ensure adequate shelter or how hospitals are coping with the influx of patients. Additionally, while both the Kerala Suchitwa Mission and the WhiteGuard Volunteer Group are involved in hospital coordination and arranging freezers, the sources do not explicitly detail how these groups are coordinating their efforts with each other[31][32].

### Kerala Rescue Operations Hindered by Severe Weather and Infrastructure Collapse

Rescue efforts in Kerala are facing significant challenges due to a combination of blocked roads, unstable terrain, bad weather, the collapse of a key bridge in Wayanad district, and relentless rain[1][2]. In response to these difficulties, the Indian army has deployed over 200 troops to the area to assist state security forces and rescue crews[11]. Despite these efforts, hundreds of people are suspected to be trapped[16]. Meanwhile, more than 100 individuals are receiving treatment for injuries, and at least 70 people have been brought to the hospital[32].

### Army-Led Rescue Efforts Ongoing Amidst Heavy Rainfall in Kerala Landslide Areas

The army-led search and rescue mission in the landslide-hit areas of Mundakkai and Chooralmala has successfully saved 1,000 people, although 392 individuals remain missing[1]. Despite the scale of the operation, there is no detailed information on how the army is coordinating with local authorities to locate these missing individuals. Meanwhile, Caritas India, the national organ of the Catholic Church's social and humanitarian responses in India[22], is actively involved in relief efforts. They are coordinating with local partners such as WSSS, Shreyas, and Jeevana[12][21], and working closely with local diocesan organizations in Wayanad to assess the needs of the affected communities[11][22][42]. This collaboration aims to plan both short-term relief support and long-term livelihood restoration and rehabilitation[11][22][42].

Caritas India has activated its Emergency response protocols and deployed a team on the ground[22]. Representatives from the organization are visiting relief camps to engage with authorities and inmates, ensuring that ongoing needs are assessed and addressed[11][22]. This grassroots approach allows Caritas to adapt its interventions and provide targeted assistance, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations receive the help they require[11][42]. Contributions are being utilized to provide immediate relief support and trauma counseling to the affected communities[23].

In response to the crisis, Andrews Thazhath, President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India, has issued a National Appeal for support. He urges all people of goodwill and Church institutions to contribute generously to this humanitarian call, emphasizing that such support can make a significant difference[21][23]. 

However, the situation remains precarious as the India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy rainfall in Kerala for the next 24 hours, which could further affect rescue operations[31]. The sources do not provide specific measures being taken to mitigate the effects of this predicted rainfall.

### Kerala Floods: Urgent Rescue Efforts Amidst Communication and Infrastructure Challenges

Caritas India is actively assessing the situation in the affected areas to identify immediate needs and plan its humanitarian response, although the specific needs and detailed plans have not been disclosed[1][4]. The Indian authorities have mobilized helicopters to assist with rescue efforts, and the Indian army has been enlisted to build temporary bridges after landslides destroyed a main bridge linking the affected area[12][14][31][32][35]. Kerala's state Health Minister, Veena George, emphasized the state's commitment to rescue efforts, stating, "We are trying every way to rescue our people"[14][16][17][18][19][20][31][35][36][37][38][39]. 

Local NGOs are utilizing drones to assess the situation and address critical shortages, such as the need for freezers for unidentified bodies, although the effectiveness of these drones has not been detailed[15][21]. Meanwhile, India's weather department has put Kerala on alert due to incessant rains, but specific safety measures for rescue teams and stranded individuals in these conditions have not been outlined[11][12]. 

So far, around 100 people have been rescued, and efforts continue to reach those still stranded[31][34]. Local TV news channels have broadcasted phone calls from stranded individuals pleading for help, highlighting the urgency of the situation[33][35][37][38][39]. Despite ongoing rescue operations, there is a critical need to re-establish connectivity in the affected areas[34]. 

The disaster in Wayanad has exposed significant shortcomings in the state's ability to communicate risks and coordinate evacuations, as many people were either unaware of the imminent danger or reluctant to evacuate due to a lack of clear and timely information[41]. The Kerala government has denied receiving warnings about the severity of the situation, which has further complicated the response efforts[41].

### Urgent Measures Needed to Prevent Electrocution from Submerged Power Lines in Delhi-NCR

The provided sources highlight incidents of deaths caused by electrocution from fallen power lines submerged in water in the Delhi-NCR region[1]. However, they do not specify any immediate measures that can be taken to prevent further casualties from this cause. Additionally, the sources do not contain information relevant to other queries.

### Wayanad Rescue Operations Hindered by Terrain and Infrastructure Destruction

Rescue operations in Wayanad district encountered numerous challenges, primarily due to the difficult terrain where rescue workers had to trek through knee-deep muck[1]. The destruction of infrastructure further complicated efforts, as a bridge linking the affected forest area to the nearest town of Chooralmala was destroyed. This necessitated the deployment of army engineers to construct a temporary or replacement crossing to restore access[5][6][7][11][13][14][15]. The task of locating victims was arduous, with nearly 40 bodies discovered 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the main landslide areas, having been swept along the Chaliyar River[1][2]. Many people were buried or carried away several miles downstream by torrents of mud, floodwater, and giant rolling boulders, which made survival extremely difficult[1][3]. The catastrophic debris flows were particularly violent, striking before dawn when people were asleep in flimsy structures, further complicating rescue efforts[8]. Large areas still required exploration and search operations to locate missing individuals[3].

### Government Mobilizes Extensive Resources for Disaster Relief and Rescue Operations

The government is actively ensuring the delivery of food and essential items to relief camps, demonstrating a commitment to support those affected by the disaster[1][2]. In addition to these efforts, authorities have dispatched vehicles carrying 20,000 litres of drinking water to the disaster area, addressing the critical need for clean water in the region[4]. 

Rescue operations are ongoing, with all available resources being utilized to locate missing persons[21]. Rescue workers are navigating through challenging conditions, including mud and uprooted trees, to reach individuals who have been stranded[21][24]. The scale of the operation is significant, with more than 200 soldiers deployed and two Indian Air Force helicopters mobilized to assist in the rescue efforts. Additionally, police drones and a dog squad are being sent to the area to aid in the search and rescue operations[23]. Despite these extensive efforts, the sources do not provide specific details on how rescue teams are prioritizing their efforts for the more than 220 individuals who remain missing or trapped under debris.

### Kerala Flood Response: Coordinated Relief Efforts Amid Severe Weather Challenges

In response to the severe weather conditions in Kerala, where the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for extremely heavy rainfall in eight districts, a comprehensive relief and rescue operation is underway. The ongoing adverse weather has significantly hindered rescue operations, particularly affecting helicopter participation in Calicut[11][12][18][20]. To mitigate these impacts, the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has deployed the Fireforce and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams, with five NDRF teams stationed in the district, including two from Bengaluru and one from Kollam[11][20]. Additionally, two Air Force helicopters are available to assist with rescue efforts, and Air Force aircraft have been used to ferry relief materials and personnel, transporting over 200 people[18][19]. The Indian Air Force is also involved in transporting essential supplies, including a Bailey Bridge[19].

A total of 118 relief camps have been established across Kerala, accommodating 5,531 inmates, with 45 camps in Wayanad district alone housing 3,069 people[1][3][12][13]. These camps, set up by local communities, community-based organizations (CBOs), and civil society organizations (CSOs) in collaboration with the government, include specific locations such as Meppadi School, Elavayal Anganwady, and St. Sebastian's Church Community Hall Chooralmala[5][7][10][11][14][15]. Rescued individuals are shifted to the nearest relief camps, where local self-government bodies have been instructed to provide clean drinking water, food, and other facilities[2][13]. The Food and Civil Supplies Department has launched steps to supply food grains and essential supplies to these camps, with support from local communities, CBOs, and CSOs[1][7][12]. Collection centers have been opened to receive packaged food items, coordinated by social media groups, and volunteers, including students from a Government Higher Secondary School at Meppadi, assist with food and supplies[8]. Food materials, including drinking water, are distributed by Indian Air Force helicopters, and the water authority has started delivering clean drinking water to the region[9]. People from tribal settlements have been provided with food, medicines, and other provisions[6][19].

For medical aid, emergency needs include medical aid, hospital facilities, and ambulances[3]. Doctors from various specialties, including surgery, orthopedics, and forensic departments, have been deployed from Kozhikode, Kannur, and Thrissur districts, with additional forensic doctors from Calicut Medical College sent to Wayanad for genetic examination of unidentified bodies[21][22][25]. Doctors' teams from four cooperative medical colleges, including those at Kozhikode and Thalassery, are preparing to reach Wayanad, supporting temporary clinics set up in mosques and madrassas in Chooralmala, and a temporary hospital established in a polytechnic college[21][22][24]. The state Health Department has opened a control room, and a 24-hour control room operates under the State police chief for public information[3][12].

To support search and rescue efforts, one Bailey Bridge and three search and rescue dogs have been airlifted from Delhi to Kannur to assist in locating humans under the landmass[17][33]. Police dogs and a drone team have also been deployed, with drone teams coming from neighboring districts[14][35][36]. Specially trained army dogs have been requested to assist in these operations[32]. Rescue teams are using ropeways to navigate rising water levels, although specific challenges faced by these teams are not detailed[41][43].

The Chief Minister has suggested that all humanitarian agencies coordinate with the district collector's office for effective humanitarian responses, and five ministers are camping in Wayanad to coordinate rescue operations[1][12][13]. Four additional assistant collectors have been deployed to Wayanad[20]. The General Education Department plans to dispatch teachers to camps to ensure children have access to education, and the University of Calicut has postponed all exams scheduled until August 2 due to the rains[19][17]. The Kerala government has declared a state of mourning on July 30 and 31[13].

Despite these efforts, challenges remain, such as 350 families currently without power and damage to electricity infrastructure, including 03KM of high tension line and 08 KM of low tension line, with no immediate plans detailed for power restoration[51][53].

### Increased Daytime Population in Vellarimala Spurs Medical Response Efforts

The daytime population in the Vellarimala area has seen a significant increase, rising to over 2 standard deviations above the baseline, which translates to an average 40% increase. This is notable despite the overall population remaining significantly below the pre-event 90-day baseline as of August 3rd[1]. However, the sources do not provide any factors or explanations for this increase in the daytime population.

In response to the health needs of the affected population in Wayanad, Kerala, doctors' teams from four cooperative medical colleges, including those at Kozhikode and Thalassery, are preparing to reach the area[11][21]. The state Health Department has taken proactive measures by opening a control room to manage the situation[11]. Furthermore, the district collectorate is setting up a medical point and an oxygen ambulance at the disaster-hit Chooralmala to provide immediate medical assistance[15].

Despite these efforts, there are notable information gaps. The sources do not offer a comprehensive list of all medical resources and personnel mobilized, nor do they specify the exact number of medical professionals, types of medical supplies, or the full range of health services being provided. Additionally, there is no information detailing how these medical teams are coordinating their efforts to address the health crisis effectively.

### Kerala Implements Emergency Measures Amid Heavy Rains and Landslides

In response to the ongoing heavy rains and landslides in Kerala, particularly in the Wayanad district, authorities have implemented several measures to ensure the safety and well-being of residents. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has placed Kerala on alert due to the persistent rainfall, which has significantly impacted the northern and central regions of the state. Wayanad district alone recorded up to 28 centimeters (11 inches) of rain over a 24-hour period, prompting the issuance of yellow alerts for heavy rain in the area[5][10][21][22][23][24][25][26][30][41][45][46][47][48][49].

In light of these conditions, schools in some parts of Kerala were closed on Tuesday as a precautionary measure[10]. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has urged the public to adhere to instructions provided by authorities to ensure their safety[1][2]. A massive rescue operation is underway in Wayanad, with efforts focused on rescuing affected individuals and delivering essential supplies to relief camps. Helicopters have been deployed to assist in these operations, although the adverse weather has complicated their use[3][8][12][13][14][15][20].

Humanitarian response efforts are being coordinated by various organizations. IAG Wayanad is actively monitoring the situation, supporting rescue operations, and coordinating relief activities. They have scheduled meetings to assess the situation and improve coordination efforts[2][12][15][31]. Sphere India has deployed technical staff to Wayanad to support the state and District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs), while the IAC Committee has activated the URS to enhance response efforts[3][4][17][20]. IAG-Kerala is also providing support to DDMAs and collection points through district IAGs[3][12].

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced compensation for the families of victims affected by the disaster[2]. Despite the challenges posed by the heavy rains, authorities are determined to leave "no stone unturned" in their rescue efforts, employing every possible means to ensure the safety and well-being of the residents[13][14].

### Urgent Action Plan Needed to Mitigate Fatal Floods and Landslides in India

Deforestation and development projects in India have significantly contributed to the problem of fatal floods and landslides, with these natural disasters often occurring in regions where human intervention has led to changes in land use[1][7]. Recent natural disasters in India, described as some of the worst the state has experienced, have included these fatal floods and landslides[41][44]. The country has seen an alarming increase in landslides in recent years[41][43][45]. 

To address the growing frequency of such natural calamities, a comprehensive action plan is urgently needed[21][22][23][33][34][35][41][43][45]. However, the sources do not specify what elements should be included in this plan, nor do they detail immediate relief efforts[21][22][23][41][43][45].

### Kerala Rescue Operations Hindered by Landslides and Severe Weather Conditions

Rescue teams in Kerala are grappling with numerous challenges as they attempt to access and evacuate affected areas. A significant obstacle is the destruction of a main crossing by landslides, which has also led to vehicles being swept off roads and becoming stuck in a swollen river, necessitating the construction of a temporary bridge and the evacuation of individuals by helicopter[2][5]. Incessant rains and adverse weather conditions have further complicated efforts, preventing helicopters from landing in the disaster area[7]. The situation is exacerbated by difficulties in understanding conditions in isolated areas, prompting requests for drones to aid in assessment[7]. Swollen rivers and rivulets continue to pose significant risks, with more rain predicted throughout the day and the possibility of heavy rains in the next 36 hours[2][7].

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast isolated thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds over Kerala in the next three hours[11][12]. In response, measures are being implemented to monitor and respond to the situation, including robust early warning systems through enhanced weather forecasting technologies to provide timely alerts[14]. There is a recognized need for localized early warning systems and monitoring rainfall data in hotspots to prepare targeted early warning systems[13]. The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has mobilized Fire force and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams to the affected areas[11]. An NDRF team, along with two teams from the Kannur Defense Security Corps, is en route, and two additional NDRF units are expected to arrive in Wayanad[11]. Assistance from the army is being sought to construct a temporary bridge, evacuate individuals by helicopter, and establish necessary arrangements at the disaster site[11]. NDRF, Police, and Fire Brigade have been actively conducting search and rescue operations[18]. Authorities have also mobilized helicopters for rescue efforts, and the Indian army is involved in building a temporary bridge[18]. To support medical needs, mortuary facilities will be increased, mobile mortuary units utilized, medicines and equipment delivered to hospitals, and ambulances and rapid response units moved to the disaster-affected region[15].

To enhance ongoing search and rescue operations, additional resources and support are needed, including drones to assess isolated areas[28][29], and freezers to store unidentified dead bodies due to a reported shortage[22][28]. The implementation of effective early warning systems is a critical component of disaster management, with significant gaps still present[23]. There is a pressing need to prepare targeted early warning systems to save lives and livelihoods[23]. Urgent mitigation measures are required, and a comprehensive action plan is necessary to address the increasing frequency of natural calamities[24].

The forecast indicates a possibility of heavy rains over the next 36 hours[31][34], with more rain expected throughout the day[32]. Light to moderate rainfall, with occasional intense to very intense showers, isolated thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds, is likely over Kerala in the next three hours[35]. Incessant rains and adverse weather conditions have already hindered planned visits to the disaster site due to the inability to land[31]. The shift to sudden, intense downpours increases the risk of floods and makes landslides more likely, as dry soils are unable to absorb heavy rains effectively[38]. The area has already experienced heavy rain that has softened the soil, making it more susceptible to landslides[37]. Kerala is particularly prone to heavy rains, flooding, and landslides[38].

### Coordinated Rescue Efforts Underway in Kerala Amidst Widespread Infrastructure Damage

Local authorities have reported that 89 people are missing, while 392 individuals, including 29 children, remain unaccounted for in the affected areas[1][2]. In response, district authorities are actively collecting data to locate these individuals[2]. Rescue operations are being conducted by a combined force of 500 to 600 personnel from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Army, State Police, forest officials, and volunteers[3][12]. The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) and NDRF teams are working tirelessly, with KSDMA mobilizing Fire force and NDRF teams to areas where hundreds are feared trapped under debris[1][11][15]. The Navy and Army, including 225 Army personnel, have been deployed for rescue operations[5][6][13][14]. Two teams from the Kannur Defence Security Corps are also assisting in these efforts[7][18].

Tamil Nadu is contributing by sending a team of medical and disaster response personnel, which includes 329 fire and rescue officers, 35 water rescue trainers, and 85 Aapta Mitra personnel[5][13]. Additionally, two Air Force helicopters are scheduled to participate in the search and rescue operations[8][17]. The Health Department and National Health Mission have established a control room and issued emergency helpline numbers to support the affected population[6]. Efforts are also underway to rebuild a bridge to facilitate the movement of earth-moving equipment necessary for digging[7][12].

Rescue teams in Kerala are facing significant challenges, including blocked roads, unstable ground, and ongoing threats from the fragile terrain, which are further hampered by every passing minute[11]. Families remain stranded in isolated areas, and there has been extensive destruction to vital infrastructure[11][16]. To mitigate these challenges, the Prime Minister is continuously monitoring the situation, and the Centre is extending all possible help to the state[3][12].

### Urgent Humanitarian Response Required for Landslide and Flood Crisis in India

To effectively analyze and address the humanitarian situation caused by landslides and floods in India, several strategic and tactical questions must be considered. One of the primary concerns is identifying the critical sectoral needs of the affected populations, as highlighted by the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) assessment, which underscores the urgent requirement for targeted humanitarian assistance to meet these evolving needs and mitigate risks effectively [1][11]. Understanding the ongoing risks of displacement in high-risk areas prone to further landslides and environmental hazards is also crucial [1].

Addressing the critical risk of flooding from blocked creeks, which could trigger additional landslides, is essential [7]. Authorities must also focus on monitoring rapid construction activities over landslide-prone areas to prevent exacerbating the situation [4][5][6]. The impact of climate change and direct human intervention, such as land use changes, must be addressed in regions where landslides and flash floods are evident [9][10]. Implementing the recommendations of the 2013 report, which proposed declaring 37% of the Western Ghats mountains as an eco-sensitive area and restricting construction, is a vital step in this direction [9][10].

Immediate emergency response and long-term recovery plans are crucial to address the needs of affected populations and mitigate future risks and vulnerabilities [1]. This includes addressing the instability of the soil, visible cracks, and ongoing geo-seismic activities to mitigate imminent threats to lives and properties [4]. Anticipated humanitarian needs, such as water, electricity, food, and dignity kits, must be considered once search and rescue operations conclude [1]. As of Thursday, 187 people were unaccounted for, highlighting the urgency of these operations, although specific resources needed to expedite them are not detailed in the sources [31].

A coordination meeting by the district Inter-Agency Group (IAG) is expected to understand emerging needs and facilitate a coordinated humanitarian response [12]. This approach is essential to ensure that the response is comprehensive and addresses all aspects of the crisis effectively [1].
