# Afghanistan Floods-Week 21 2024 

## Summary 
Afghanistan is experiencing severe flooding across its western, northern, and northeastern regions, marking the largest flooding event this year and affecting thousands of families[46]. These floods have led to significant casualties, with at least 347 fatalities and over 1,651 injuries reported in Baghlan, Badakhshan, and Takhar provinces alone, and overall casualties are expected to increase[64]. The disaster has caused extensive damage to infrastructure, including approximately 9,000 homes, vital bridges, roads, health facilities, and schools, while also destroying nearly 14,000 livestock and 24,000 hectares of agricultural land, making many affected areas inaccessible[39]. Humanitarian organizations such as WHO, WFP, and UNICEF, along with various clusters (Health, Protection, Shelter, Food Security and Agriculture Cluster), are actively providing emergency response, including medical supplies, food assistance, emergency shelter, hygiene kits, and addressing critical needs like clean water, mental health support, and disease surveillance[7]. While some food prices saw a negligible decrease in May 2024, they remain significantly higher than pre-COVID levels, and acute malnutrition is above emergency thresholds in most provinces[32]. Additionally, Afghanistan continues to manage the return of over 589,700 individuals recorded up to May 18, 2024, primarily from Pakistan[17].

## Cluster Summaries

### Afghani Appreciation Drives Deflation Amidst Food Price and Fertilizer Declines

The appreciation of the Afghani (AFN) against the US Dollar (USD) has been a significant factor contributing to persistent deflation in Afghanistan. Throughout 2023, the AFN consistently appreciated against the USD, maintaining a relatively stable exchange rate between AFN 70 and AFN 74 per USD since November 2023[2][4][11][12][13][14]. This currency stability has coincided with a notable decrease in the prices of most food items compared to the same period last year[14]. The World Food Program (WFP) in-kind food basket's value in Afghani showed a continuous decline from June 2022 to September 2023, with a further decrease observed in December 2023[17].

In addition to currency appreciation, the prices of staple foods such as wheat flour, rice, and cooking oil experienced a downward trend in the third week of May 2024, attributed to a marginal decline in their global prices[41]. Similarly, national average fertilizer prices have decreased significantly compared to the previous year, driven by a reduction in global fertilizer prices and decreased domestic demand[44].

Despite these economic trends, challenges remain in addressing the impacts of negative Land Surface Temperature (LST) on vegetation and below-average soil moisture, although improvements are expected[21]. The Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) is tasked with ensuring that food assistance packages meet minimum humanitarian standards across Afghanistan. This involves a uniform approach to avoid inequality and improper resource utilization[31][32]. The packages are designed to provide a minimum of 2100 kcal per person per day during emergencies, addressing the "food gap" after considering the population's capacity to meet their own needs[33]. Beneficiaries' preferences and consumption habits are also taken into account, with feedback from partners incorporated into the package design[33]. These guidelines are thoroughly discussed and agreed upon with FSAC partners, donors, and humanitarian agencies in various meetings[37].

### Challenges in Food Security and Housing for Afghan Returnees and Host Communities

The Multi-Sectoral Rapid Needs Assessment Teams (MRAT) have identified significant challenges faced by both returnee and host population households, particularly in the areas of food security, financial aid, and housing[1]. In response to these challenges, various organizations are actively monitoring and managing the situation at Afghanistan's borders. The Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) Afghanistan's Flow Monitoring activity employs two interconnected exercises to assess and understand mobility dynamics at these borders[11]. The first exercise, Flow Monitoring Counting (FMC), involves a headcount of all individuals entering or leaving Afghanistan, including returnees, to measure the flow volume[11]. The second exercise, the Flow Monitoring Survey (FMS), surveys randomly selected Afghan nationals or groups crossing the borders to gather insights into their profiles, motivations, and vulnerabilities[11]. DTM initiated these activities at four border crossing points with Iran and Pakistan on January 10, 2024, and expanded to include Ghulam Khan as of February 11[11].

In parallel, the Border Consortium is actively monitoring the situation in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Pakistan, ensuring that confirmed updates are promptly communicated[21][22]. To prepare for potential future surges, the Consortium is working with partners on preparedness plans[21]. This includes reviewing their contingency plan for the Pakistan border and collaborating with regional Consortium coordination groups to evaluate partners' capacity to maintain or scale up operations as needed[22]. Additionally, the Consortium has updated its 2023-2024 Border appeal and is engaging with partners and donors to anticipate resource gaps and ensure adequate resources are available in the event of a renewed influx[23]. Consortium Partners have progressively scaled up and adjusted operations at both the Spin Boldak and Torkham Border Points to address the significant increase in returns since mid-September 2023[23].

### Flood Damage Severely Impacts Health Services and Aid Delivery in Northeast Region

The western region is currently grappling with significant challenges as several health facilities have become partially or non-operational due to extensive flood damage[1]. In Baghlan province, numerous health facilities have been reported as non-operational, contributing to the broader issue of significant damage to public infrastructure, including health services, in the Northeast Region[2][8]. This infrastructure damage extends across Baghlan, Badakhshan, and Takhar provinces, further complicating the situation[8].

In response to these challenges, the World Health Organization (WHO) has taken proactive measures to support affected health facilities and communities. WHO successfully transported a substantial consignment of 30 metric tonnes of essential medicines, medical kits, tents, and solar lights to Ghor province[1]. Additionally, the WHO Afghanistan Office delivered 25 metric tonnes of emergency medical kits, tents, and solar lights to the same region[2]. To further bolster relief efforts, WHO is mobilizing an additional 5 metric tonnes of medicines and medical supplies from its Mazar warehouse to Faryab Provincial Hospital and partners' Mobile Health Teams, which are providing health services in the affected districts of Faryab province[2].

However, humanitarian organizations are encountering significant challenges in delivering aid due to the extensive damage to infrastructure and resulting accessibility issues[11][12][16]. The damage to roads and bridges is particularly severe, with 50 bridges and 30 electricity dams damaged in Baghlan Province alone[11]. Many locations remain inaccessible for humanitarian teams, as flooding has disrupted access to affected areas[11][12]. The challenging terrains, landslides, and flooded roads have severely hampered relief operations[11]. Blocked roads and significant physical access issues, especially in Guzargah Noor, Khost, and Jelga districts in Baghlan province, have rendered areas like Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak inaccessible by road[19]. In the Northeast, some roads have also been rendered inaccessible, slowing down joint assessment teams[11].

The destroyed infrastructure has significantly hampered aid delivery and efforts to reach areas in need[11][13]. This has caused delays in the initial days of the response, with relief organizations struggling to deliver aid to affected people[11][13]. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, with concerns about people trapped under collapsed buildings or structures[21][24]. Hundreds have been reported to be trapped in their homes beneath mud[21].

The main obstacles hindering these efforts include challenging terrains and damaged infrastructure, such as roads and bridges[23]. Safety concerns and blocked roads posed initial challenges, further complicating relief operations and aid delivery[21][23]. Large-scale infrastructure damage is reported, including structural damage to vital bridges and roads[31][33]. In Baghlan Province, 50 bridges have been damaged[32], and public infrastructure has been critically impacted, including the temporary closure of the Ghor-Herat highway[34]. Roads, bridges, health facilities, and public schools have sustained damage and destruction[36].

This extensive damage has significantly impacted humanitarian aid delivery and access, with many locations remaining inaccessible for humanitarian teams[31]. The challenging terrains and damaged infrastructure have hampered relief operations and efforts to reach areas in need of assistance[33]. Across all three provinces in the Northeast, some roads have been rendered inaccessible, slowing down joint assessment teams[32]. Several roads and thoroughfares, particularly in Guzargah Noor, Khost, and Jelga districts in Baghlan province, have resulted in significant physical access issues[38]. Blocked roads caused initial challenges and delays in the first days of the response[33]. Certain areas like Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak remain inaccessible by road due to the damage caused by flooding[33]. Overall, the destroyed infrastructure has hampered aid delivery and efforts to find the missing, with flooding disrupting accessibility to affected areas[34].

### UNICEF Emergency Response to Northern Afghanistan Floods: Child Protection and Education Efforts

Since the beginning of the year, more than 30,000 people have been affected by floods across Afghanistan, with 30,055 individuals impacted prior to the most recent flooding episode[2][3][8]. The recent floods have predominantly struck the northern regions of the country, significantly impacting provinces such as Faryab, Ghor, Baghlan, and Takhar[2][4][5]. Before this latest flooding, the southern and western regions were primarily affected[3][4]. In response, UNICEF is concentrating its efforts on the most severely affected provinces in the northern and western regions[8].

The Child Protection Area of Responsibility (CPAoR) rapid assessment has revealed that 554 children are in need of child protection services, comprising 290 girls and 264 boys[11][12]. UNICEF Emergency Response Teams are actively supporting ongoing interventions in the flood-affected areas, which include water trucking and the distribution of essential supplies[21][22][23]. These supplies consist of hygiene kits, family kits, blankets, tarpaulins, floor mats, teaching and learning materials, High-Performance Tents to facilitate the resumption of educational services, and multi-purpose cash[21][22][23][26].

In Baghlan province, the flooding has severely disrupted educational services, with 23 public schools affected and an additional 23 public schools and 21 Community-Based Education (CBE) classes destroyed[31][33]. To address this, UNICEF is implementing several measures to ensure the continuation of education for affected children. These measures include the provision of 78 High-Performance Tents, 161 floormats, 80 whiteboards and markers, 137 teacher kits, and 227 student kits to 23 public schools across four districts in Baghlan province[31]. Furthermore, UNICEF has supported three flood-affected CBEs, allowing 85 children, including 45 girls and 40 boys, to resume their education in the most impacted districts of Sheikh Jalal and Karkar villages in Baghlani Jadid and Puli Khumri[31]. Additionally, 20 High-Performance Tents and 200 floormats have been dispatched for use in CBE classes[33]. Essential supplies, such as floor mats, teaching and learning materials, and High-Performance Tents, are being provided to facilitate the resumption of educational services[39]. Currently, 180 children, half of whom are girls, are attending three child-friendly spaces integrated with CBE classes[31].

### Critical Medical Supply Shortage and Enhanced WHO Response in Ghor Province

An assessment of Ghor Provincial Hospital has highlighted a critical need for medicine and medical supplies in the affected district, prompting an additional team of four WHO members to join the Ghor response teams to provide enhanced medical and technical support to the ongoing operations[1]. WHO is actively distributing essential medical supplies, including trauma kits and medications, to communities in Ghor Province that have been impacted by floods[2]. To further bolster the response, WHO plans to deploy additional Surveillance Support Teams (SSTs) to improve active disease surveillance in the affected districts, which will facilitate the early detection and timely response to potential outbreaks of communicable diseases, particularly waterborne illnesses[7][31]. Efforts are also underway to ensure that medicines, medical supplies, and consumables are available to health facilities serving the affected population in Ghor for the next three months[5].

In Faryab province, initiatives are in progress to repair and rehabilitate two health centers that have been destroyed[11]. Health Cluster partners have deployed five Mobile Health and Nutrition Teams (MHNTs) to the districts of Bilcheragh, Pashtun Kot, and Maimana in Faryab province to deliver emergency healthcare services[11]. However, the sources do not specify how these partners are coordinating the rehabilitation efforts of the health facilities.

The Health Cluster organized a three-day training on minimum standards, conducted in two batches: the first from April 28-30 and the second from April 29-May 01[21]. This training was a collaborative effort involving the AAP Working Group, Gender in Humanitarian Action (GiHA) Working Group, Disability Inclusion Working Group (DIWG), Protection Cluster, and the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) network, with the aim of enhancing humanitarian response standards[21]. However, the specific outcomes of this training or how these standards are being applied in the current flood response are not detailed in the provided sources.

### Urgent Resource Mobilization Needed for Flood-Affected Areas in Afghanistan

In Afghanistan, the urgent need for additional resources to replenish emergency stockpiles is critical, particularly for items such as tents, Non-Food Items (NFIs), emergency shelter repair tool kits, and plastic tarpaulin[1]. The mobilization and prepositioning of medical supplies are also essential to alleviate the suffering of communities affected by floods[6]. However, these efforts are significantly challenged by the destruction of main roads and bridges, which hampers the transportation of essential supplies and isolates communities[4]. To overcome these obstacles, alternative transportation methods are necessary to reach these isolated areas[1][23]. Furthermore, enhancing collaboration among partners is crucial for a more coordinated and effective response, which involves improved information sharing, coordinated activities, and leveraging each partner's strengths to maximize impact, leading to better resource allocation and reduced duplication of efforts[9].

FSAC partners are planning to reach flood-affected people in several districts, including Maimana, Qaysar, Almar, Dawlat Abad, Bilcheragh, Gurziwan, Pashtun Kot, Khwaja Sabz Posh, Ferozkoh, Charsada, Pasaband, Shahrak, Tolak, and Saghar[11]. A regional FSAC team will be deployed to provide coordination and response support once the road from Hirat to Ghor is reopened[11]. However, humanitarian partners face significant challenges in reaching vulnerable populations due to road damages, particularly in Guzargahe Noor district, Baghlan province, where essential supplies cannot be transported through the road network[21]. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Cluster partners also struggle to reach affected populations due to severe damage to transportation infrastructure, including roads and bridges, which results in isolated communities and hindered movement between villages by flowing rivers[22]. The blockade of the Herat to Ghor road further complicates the delivery of emergency supplies from Herat[22].

In addition to logistical challenges, key protection risks in Afghanistan's flood-affected areas include protracted displacement, mine and explosive ordnance contamination, discrimination, and denial of access to services, resources, and humanitarian assistance[31]. Other risks involve restrictions to freedom of movement, a growing threat of forced evictions, increased risks of gender-based violence (GBV), child labor, and early marriage[31]. There is also a heightened need for mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), psychological first aid (PFA), and concerns regarding civil documentation[39][32][40]. These risks contribute to a shrinking protection space, particularly affecting women, girls, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees, persons living with disabilities, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups[31][51].

To address these issues, protection partners are mobilizing resources to provide MHPSS and legal assistance for vulnerable groups[34]. Mobile response teams are being mobilized to address a spectrum of protection needs, including support for GBV[53]. Key concerns include mental health and psychological distress, with critical priority activities identified such as psychosocial support, group and individual therapy sessions, and training for caretakers and community leaders on life skills[52]. Protection Cluster partners are actively delivering psychological support services, positive parenting resources, individual therapy for resilience, awareness and counseling sessions, and community dialogue[52]. Thirteen mobile response teams are being mobilized in Ghor, Herat, and Badghis provinces to provide MHPSS and PFA[53]. It is essential to include at least one female health worker or female psychosocial counselor in each response team[54].

The primary focus of a recent meeting was to discuss flood and cholera prevention measures and find solutions to challenges arising from these issues[41][42]. The level of destruction significantly impacts the overall living conditions and hygiene within IDP camps, posing a significant risk of cholera outbreak[41][42]. Representatives and governance structures of IDP communities are involved in providing detailed information on flood-related damage to households and latrines in multiple IDP sites[41][42]. However, the provided sources do not specify the exact measures being taken to prevent cholera outbreaks in IDP camps in Afghanistan.

### Afghanistan Flood Response: WFP and Partners Implement Immediate and Long-Term Strategies

The Early Warning Information Working Group (EWIWG) plays a crucial role in addressing forecasted weather patterns by delivering comprehensive presentations on early warning information to cluster partners. These presentations include detailed precipitation forecasts, such as the expectation of below-average rainfall for the 2023-24 winter wet season (October 2023 to March 2024) [1][2][3]. However, there was a likely chance of above-average precipitation in most of Afghanistan from January 2023 to March 2024, despite rainfall analysis since November 1 indicating below-average precipitation [1][2][3]. Between December 2023 and January 2024, the country experienced below-average precipitation, but February saw significant rainfall [4]. Average precipitation is anticipated from March to May 2024 [1][2]. In terms of temperature, above-average temperatures were forecasted for the entire year, contributing to unseasonably warm conditions that have led to floods [5][6]. As of March 15, 2024, the snowpack across the country remains below average [2]. The EWIWG's efforts focus on presenting early warning information, but specific measures to mitigate impacts on agriculture and food security are not detailed in the provided sources.

In response to the recent floods in Afghanistan, the World Food Programme (WFP) has implemented both immediate and long-term strategies [15][16][17][18][19]. The immediate response involved activating a contingency plan, prepositioning food stocks in Herat and Mazar, and mobilizing within three hours of the floods to distribute fortified biscuits and lipid-based nutrient supplements in affected areas [11][13][17]. High-energy biscuits, nutritional supplements, and subsidized bread rations were distributed to accessible households [11][13]. WFP also began providing food rations and cash assistance where markets were functional, initiating multi-purpose cash assistance of AFN 6,400 (USD 87.7) from May 15 [15][20]. Additionally, WFP is setting up rub-halls for storage and dispatching food trucks to support distribution efforts [20]. Joint Assessment teams are actively reporting on priority locations and impacts [17].

For long-term strategies, WFP plans to provide full food and nutrition assistance for two months, followed by a reduced distribution for four months [11][13]. Resilience activities will be integrated into recovery programs to mitigate further losses [13]. WFP has called for an additional $14.5 million to support emergency food, nutrition assistance, and resilience-building projects [14]. Investments in climate adaptation projects, such as protective walls, dams, and irrigation canals, are also underway to shield communities from climate impacts [15].

Families like Hanifa's in the Behsood e Markazi district face dire economic challenges due to limited job opportunities for women and harsh winter conditions [21]. Her son, the family's caretaker, can only work for three to four months a year, leaving them reliant on relief agencies and villagers during winter [22][23]. Most residents in this remote district live below the poverty line, struggling to afford basic winter necessities despite owning agricultural plots [22]. Hanifa's 90-year-old mother-in-law requires a warm room and winter clothes due to her grave illness [23]. Cash distribution is a critical tool to address these challenges, providing emergency support for winterization needs [23]. People in Need, funded by the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, distributed cash to nearly 13,000 people in Maidan Wardak, Central Afghanistan [23]. Hanifa's family received cash assistance after their financial situation was assessed [23]. WFP's cash assistance complements the average income of Afghan households, enabling them to meet essential needs [25].

The "Goodness Train" initiative, organized by Türkiye's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), contributes to the humanitarian response by delivering aid to flood victims in Afghanistan [31]. This campaign, launched amid Afghanistan's calls for international aid, involves a train carrying 619 tons of humanitarian aid, including 600 tents, food, hygiene kits, beds, and blankets, collected by AFAD and 17 NGOs [31][32]. The "Goodness Train" series began after the 2022 turmoil, with Türkiye previously sending emergency aid by plane [32].
