# Flooding in Nigeria-Week 37 2024 

## Summary 
Borno State, Nigeria, is grappling with severe flooding, described as the worst in 30 years, primarily caused by heavy rainfall and the collapse or overflow of the Alau Dam on the Ngadda River around September 10, 2024[72]. This disaster has affected over 414,000 people as of September 11, 2024, with more than 230,000 to 400,000 individuals displaced and registered in relocation sites[46]. At least 37 people have died and 58 sustained injuries[1], while thousands of homes, infrastructure, schools, hospitals, and markets have been submerged or their access hampered, with 15% to 50% of Maiduguri city underwater[9]. The flooding exacerbates a pre-existing humanitarian crisis, including armed conflict, widespread malnutrition, and a failing economy, occurring during the lean season and leading to shortages of food and water, alongside a heightened risk of disease outbreaks like cholera and malaria[75]. In response, evacuation of high-risk areas is ongoing, and search and rescue operations are underway by government agencies, military, and local divers[52]. The UN and its partners, including WFP, UNICEF, and WHO, are providing emergency food assistance, hot meals, shelter, water, health services, and hygiene kits, while appealing for additional support to address the escalating humanitarian crisis[18]. Although floodwaters are beginning to recede in some areas, many residents' homes remain flooded, and the overall situation requires immediate action[46].

## Cluster Summaries

### Urgent Coordination Needed for Flood Response Amidst Concurrent Disease Outbreaks

The recent floods in Maiduguri have displaced 157,274 individuals, leaving thousands homeless and in urgent need of assistance[2][3]. The immediate priorities for these affected populations include securing safe places to stay, providing crucial psychosocial support, and ensuring access to first aid and healthcare services[6][9]. In response to this crisis, the humanitarian community must act swiftly to address these needs[3].

To facilitate an effective response, DTM Nigeria initiates a rapid assessment within the first 24-48 hours following such incidents. This assessment aims to document the event, identify the urgent needs of those affected, gather demographic information, and evaluate the overall impact[3]. Emergency response teams are then deployed to the most severely affected areas, as the scale of the disaster demands a comprehensive approach to ensure that all individuals receive the necessary assistance[4][5].

However, the coordination among various stakeholders involved in the response efforts is currently suboptimal. This is largely due to the simultaneous outbreaks of Diphtheria, Cerebrospinal Meningitis (CSM), and Lassa fever, which complicate the implementation of a cohesive and effective strategy to manage these health crises[11]. The sources do not provide specific guidance on improving coordination for these concurrent outbreaks, highlighting a significant challenge in the overall response efforts[11].

### Nigeria Flood Crisis: Alau Dam Collapse Triggers Humanitarian and Infrastructure Emergency

The severe flooding in Nigeria, particularly following the collapse of the Alau Dam on the Ngadda River in Maiduguri, Borno State, has led to a humanitarian crisis with significant challenges and needs. The dam's failure resulted in the submersion of buildings and the displacement of over 239,000 residents, as reported by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other sources[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. As floodwaters recede, residents are beginning to return to their homes to assess their losses, although specific plans to support their return remain unclear[21][30].

The flooding has caused catastrophic damage to infrastructure, property, and homes, with thousands of homes submerged and vast areas of Maiduguri underwater[31][35][36][38]. Key public buildings and areas affected include the Government House, Monday Market, Moromoro, Gwange, State Lowcost Estate, NUJ Press Centre, Lagos Street, Shehu of Borno's palace, and parts of the University of Maiduguri[38]. Cemeteries were breached, leading to corpses floating in the floodwaters[38]. The destruction extends to roads and transport networks, severely restricting access to hospitals, schools, and markets, and disrupting road traffic[34][38]. Damage to infrastructure, including bridges, has been recorded, and local telecommunications and electricity networks have been compromised[33][38].

The flooding has also devastated agriculture, with approximately 110,000 hectares of farmland in Borno State significantly damaged, although the economic loss remains unspecified[42][43][48][49]. In response to the crisis, several measures are being implemented to address the immediate needs of the affected population. Malteser International is distributing cholera prevention and hygiene kits in Bakasi refugee camp[52][53][55][58][60]. The UN and NGO partners are using helicopters to deliver life-saving assistance, including food and non-food items, to isolated communities[57]. The Yobe State Emergency Management Authority (SEMA), in collaboration with the Nigerian Red Cross, is conducting a rapid needs assessment to inform the humanitarian response[55]. Heads of UN agencies, NGOs, and the Nigerian Red Cross Society have pledged continued support to government efforts and are mobilizing additional resources for the lifesaving response[58][60]. In Adamawa, relief assistance is being provided by the state government, UN agencies, and partners[55]. President Bola Tinubu has ordered massive evacuations and committed to relief efforts[60].

Strategic and tactical questions remain regarding the affected population's primary needs, vulnerabilities, and mobility intentions[6]. There is a pressing need to address the risk of disease outbreaks, particularly from contaminated water, and to prevent further outbreaks of waterborne and communicable diseases[5]. The technical assessment of the Alau Dam situation and the extent of the flood disaster has provided findings and recommendations that need to be considered[10]. Additionally, funding requirements and logistical challenges have hampered the evacuation of people trapped in submerged areas[6]. Emergency measures must be activated to mitigate the impact of probable future flooding in regions like the Niger Delta and other southern states[6]. Finally, understanding the extent of losses sustained by residents and their recovery needs as floodwaters recede is crucial for effective response and recovery planning[10].

### Nigeria Flood Crisis: Urgent Infrastructure and Humanitarian Response Needed

To effectively address the humanitarian crisis in Nigeria caused by devastating floods, a comprehensive approach involving policy, infrastructure, humanitarian response, and international cooperation is essential. A critical starting point is the integration of climate adaptation with disaster risk management within a national policy framework. This integration can help build a more resilient and responsive disaster management system, which is crucial for mitigating the impacts of such natural disasters[2][6]. The government must also focus on developing and maintaining adequate infrastructure, including proper urban planning, adequate drainage systems, and sufficient investment in flood control measures, to manage water flow and handle heavy rainfall[4].

Infrastructure improvements are vital, requiring investments in repairing and upgrading existing drainage systems, constructing new ones, and developing sustainable urban planning policies that prevent construction in flood-prone areas[10]. Enhancing early warning systems for floods and effectively communicating these warnings to communities and stakeholders can prevent deaths from drowning, diseases related to water contamination, and the collapse of structures[4]. The current infrastructure challenges, such as inadequate drainage systems, lack of proper urban planning, and insufficient investment in flood control measures, have been identified as significant issues in the affected areas[22][24][26]. These challenges have led to overwhelmed drainage systems during heavy rains, impacting the delivery of essential services like communication, power, and water supply[22][26][27].

In terms of humanitarian response, clear communication and collaboration are necessary to ensure that aid is distributed efficiently and reaches those who need it most[6]. Expediting search and rescue operations and effectively carrying out the immediate evacuation of residents are critical[2]. Essential relief items, food, and water must be provided promptly to prevent disease outbreaks[9]. Emergency aid and long-term recovery strategies are needed for those pushed into poverty by the destruction of homes and livelihoods[7]. Special attention must be given to protecting unaccompanied children and disabled persons[8], and addressing the exacerbation of the food and nutrition crisis, especially for the 4.8 million people in dire need in conflict-affected areas[1]. Effective response strategies for agricultural communities affected by floods are also necessary, with early warning systems playing a role in helping farmers boost food production[4].

Securing more resources and urgent global support is crucial to save lives, address immediate crises, and plan for longer-term recovery and solutions[7]. Increasing financial contributions from donors to fully fund the Humanitarian Response Plan is essential[4]. International cooperation, along with technical and financial support, can be leveraged to build Nigeria's resilience against climate-induced disasters[10].

The ongoing rescue operations, coordinated by the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), have successfully rescued at least 3,683 people trapped by severe flooding. These operations involve the deployment of boats, canoes, local divers, military, and fire trucks[11][31]. This coordinated effort highlights the importance of having a robust emergency response system in place to effectively manage such crises.

### Comprehensive Response to Nigeria's Crisis: Rescue, Medical Aid, and Resource Distribution

Efforts to address the crises in Nigeria involve a multifaceted approach, focusing on both rescue operations and the provision of essential resources. Various modes of rescue, including motorists, boats, canoes, divers, military, and fire service trucks, are actively engaged in operations, with the military deploying four speed boats to reinforce these efforts[1][2]. However, the exact number of additional boats, canoes, or divers required to expedite these operations remains unspecified[3][5].

In response to the medical needs of displaced individuals, particularly after the main hospital in Maiduguri was affected by flooding, several immediate measures have been implemented. Mobile clinics, along with medical supplies and doctors from the military hospital, have been dispatched to camps to provide necessary medical care[12][13][14]. To combat potential outbreaks of water-borne diseases, water trucks have been deployed to supply clean water, and a mobile water treatment plant has been set up in Maiduguri[12][15]. Furthermore, all Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps, including the Ikyogen refugee camp, have been fumigated to mitigate the risk of snake bites[12]. Organizations such as Malteser International are actively involved in providing potable water and implementing cholera prevention measures[16].

Despite these efforts, challenges persist in ensuring adequate food and essential supplies for those in camps. While food and non-food items are being distributed, shortages have led to people rushing for food, highlighting the need for improved nutritional support, particularly for vulnerable groups like children and pregnant women[23][30]. The acting Zonal Coordinator, North-East of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Surajo Garba, has acknowledged ongoing efforts to supply these items, though specific strategies to enhance food distribution and prevent shortages and conflicts are not detailed in the sources[47].

Water-borne diseases are being controlled through the provision of clean water, with organizations like Malteser International focusing on cholera prevention[33][36]. Addressing open defecation is also identified as a critical step in reducing the transmission of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), which are spread through contaminated soil and feces, thereby improving sanitation and hygiene practices[34]. However, the sources do not provide detailed information on how water-borne diseases are being monitored[38][39].

### Coordinated Flood Response and Rescue Operations in Borno State and Beyond

Efforts to rescue children and families trapped in their homes due to severe flooding are ongoing, with the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation (FMHAPA) actively supporting states in evacuating those at risk[6][10]. In Borno State, the government has initiated search and rescue operations in areas isolated by flash floods, utilizing boats and canoes provided by the military and private individuals[15]. Additionally, partners have facilitated the delivery of food to these cut-off areas using helicopters[15].

Coordination of these efforts is being managed by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), which is conducting Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) meetings with stakeholders, activating the Emergency Operation Centre (EOC), and organizing sector meetings to address the flood situation[16]. FMHAPA is collaborating with state governments and State Emergency Management Agencies (SEMAs) to conduct needs assessments and support the evacuation of at-risk populations[17]. Plans are also in place to support Naval Disaster Response Units (DRUs) in riverine communities with boats and life jackets for marine rescue operations[18].

In response to the damage in Borno State, immediate plans include the rehabilitation of sanitation facilities and the provision of emergency shelter[21][28]. FMHAPA is also aiding states in the relocation and rehabilitation of displaced individuals[24]. Coordination is further strengthened through ECF meetings and sector meetings led by NEMA[37]. A mission involving UN agency heads, country directors of international and local NGOs, and donors has engaged with the Governor of Borno, his cabinet, federal ministers, representatives, and local humanitarian staff to discuss the situation[33].

The World Health Organization (WHO) is closely collaborating with health authorities, and international partners, including WHO, have pledged support to the government[31][35]. ActionAid Nigeria is working alongside local governments and international partners to address the crisis[38]. In other flood-affected states, the Ministry of Health is conducting weekly meetings to coordinate the response[39].

### Comprehensive Response Strategy for Flood Crisis in Maiduguri, Nigeria

To effectively address the humanitarian crisis in Maiduguri caused by severe flooding, a comprehensive approach involving both strategic and tactical considerations is essential. Strategically, optimizing federal assistance in collaboration with state authorities is crucial to meet immediate humanitarian needs and develop long-term solutions for flooding across Nigeria[8]. Implementing comprehensive flood mitigation measures is vital, especially in light of the structural damage to the Alau Dam and the increasing threats posed by climate change[6]. Additionally, managing the "crisis within a crisis"—which includes conflict, record food price inflation, and floods—requires a holistic approach to restore stability and support recovery in Maiduguri[9]. Mobilizing and allocating funding from various sources, such as the NHF, RRF, and CERF, is necessary to address critical needs and fill gaps in the nationwide flood response[10].

Tactically, the immediate needs identified by the Rapid Needs Assessment Report for over 300,000 displaced people in 30 relocation sites include food, shelter, and clean water, which must be met efficiently[1][3][4][5][31][33]. Restoring and maintaining access to affected areas and camps is challenging due to the collapse or partial collapse of key infrastructure like the Gwange and Lagos Street bridges[8][19]. Specific WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) interventions are needed to prevent outbreaks of communicable diseases such as acute watery diarrhea and cholera, and strengthening disease surveillance and outbreak preparedness is critical[5]. The provision of hot meals and specialized nutritious foods by WFP and partners must be scaled to meet the needs of the worst-affected children, women, and men across all camps[9]. Additionally, actions to mitigate the expected increase in cases of malaria and other vector-borne diseases are necessary[1].

The Nigerian military's disaster response units and SEMA's efforts must be coordinated to maximize search and rescue operations and reach inaccessible areas where people are trapped[3][51][52]. The risks posed by escaped animals from the Maiduguri Zoo need to be managed to ensure community safety[1]. Overcoming the challenges posed by insecurity, which hinders aid efforts, is also crucial[1][19][41].

Humanitarian agencies face significant challenges in accessing flood-affected areas, with limited access for mobile outreach disrupting essential health services like vaccinations and regular medical consultations[17]. Insecurity further complicates aid efforts, and access is restricted due to damaged infrastructure, leaving some communities isolated and without telecommunications and electricity[19]. UNICEF is addressing health and nutrition needs in Maiduguri's flood evacuation sites by supporting three sites: Bakassi, Dalori, and Teachers Village[21]. Health centers established in these camps provide nutrition services, including screening and treatment of severe malnutrition, and offer family tracing for unaccompanied and separated children, gender-based violence support, and psycho-social support[21][23]. UNICEF has also prepositioned malaria and cholera detection and treatment kits and distributed kits for acute watery diarrhea to affected communities[29]. Healthcare kits for 4,000 people have been provided[26][28][29].

The flooding has exacerbated the existing humanitarian crisis in a region already suffering from the Boko Haram insurgency, with insecurity further hindering aid efforts[41]. The State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) is actively setting up and managing temporary camps in Maiduguri and conducting search and rescue operations[51][52]. In partnership with WFP and INTERSOS, SEMA has scaled up its hot meals program in the Teachers' Village and Yerwa camps[51]. The Nigerian military has activated 22 disaster response units in Borno and across north-east Nigeria to assist in reaching inaccessible areas and conducting search and rescue operations for those trapped by the flooding[51][52].
