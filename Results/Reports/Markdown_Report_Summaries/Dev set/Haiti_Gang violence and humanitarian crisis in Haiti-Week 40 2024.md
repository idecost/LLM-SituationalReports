# Gang violence and humanitarian crisis in Haiti-Week 40 2024 

## Summary 
Haiti is currently facing a worsening humanitarian crisis driven by alarming rates of armed gang violence, which has severely disrupted daily life, forced mass displacement, and exacerbated acute food insecurity[63][139][142]. Armed gangs control nearly 80% of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince and are expanding into rural regions, terrorizing residents with killings, rapes, and kidnappings, while also impeding the movement of people and goods[3]. A recent attack on October 3, 2024, in the Pont Sond area of the Artibonite department, resulted in at least 70 deaths and 357 injuries, displacing an estimated 6,270 people[135][136][138]. Over 700,000 people are internally displaced across the country, a 22% increase since June, with many lacking essential food, water, shelter, and medical care[75]. Nearly half of Haiti's population, over 5 million people, is experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or worse) between August 2024 and February 2025, including 6,000 people facing catastrophic hunger (IPC Phase 5) and 2 million at emergency levels (IPC Phase 4)[124][139][142]. In response to the escalating violence, Prime Minister Garry Conille announced a joint operation with Kenyan police on August 29, 2024, to target criminal gangs in Port-au-Prince[129], and a UN-backed Kenyan mission, which began in late June, is working to quell violence but requires substantial additional personnel and resources[63]. The crisis also poses severe protection risks for children, with an average of five killed per week in the first half of 2024, and leaves women and girls highly vulnerable to gender-based violence[41].

## Cluster Summaries

### Haitian National Police Intensifies Efforts Amid Escalating Artibonite Gang Violence

The Haitian National Police is intensifying its efforts to address the security challenges in the country. Agents from the Temporary Anti-Gang Unit (UTAG) have been deployed as reinforcements to support teams already on the ground, as part of a broader strategy to enhance security interventions in the area[1][10][12]. In a move to strengthen the police force, the director of police in charge of the Artibonite department has been replaced[7][15]. This change is part of the Haitian government's plan to bolster the capacity and resources of the Haitian National Police, with support from international partners[17].

In addition to these internal measures, the Haitian government has requested that a UN-backed mission, initially mandated to assist the under-resourced police in restoring order, be transformed into a formal UN peacekeeping mission[19]. This request underscores the severity of the situation and the need for international assistance.

The situation in Haiti's Artibonite department has been particularly dire, with reports of gang violence escalating. A spokeswoman for a local civil society group reported that an attack occurred following threats from Gran Grif leader Luckson Elan against individuals who refused to pay tolls on a nearby highway[21]. The United Nations Human Rights Office (OHCHR) has documented these gang attacks, with a spokesperson revealing that at least 70 people were killed in the violence in Pont-Sonde, located in the Artibonite department[41][45][46][47]. Thameen Al-Kheetan, an OHCHR spokesperson, expressed horror at the attacks, highlighting the urgent need for effective intervention[45][47].

Despite these reports, the sources do not provide specific details on the support required by local civil society groups to assist affected communities, nor do they outline the specific support the OHCHR is providing to local authorities. The complexity of the situation in Haiti calls for a coordinated response to restore peace and security in the region.

### Haiti Faces Severe Food Insecurity Amid Displacement and Economic Instability

The severe food insecurity experienced by families in Haiti is primarily driven by a combination of displacement, economic instability, and scarcity of resources. Many families are forced to flee their homes due to gang raids, which restricts their access to markets and essential goods[2][5][6]. This displacement exacerbates the already dire situation, as individuals like Alexandra, who fled to the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, find themselves unable to access markets and consequently lack sufficient food[21].

The economic landscape further complicates the situation, with the drying up of construction jobs leaving individuals like Jean Yonel, a former mason, to seek alternative means of income by searching for wood to make charcoal[11][12][14][15][16][35]. His wife contributes by selling second-hand clothes, yet despite their efforts, they struggle to provide daily for their seven children[14][20]. On many days, the family subsists on basic foods like white rice or spaghetti[13][32][33][34], and sometimes Yonel and his wife take only a spoonful of food, leaving the rest for their children to prevent them from dying[12][16][17][32][35]. The available food, often meant for one person, is stretched to feed ten, providing only enough nourishment to survive[15][35].

The scarcity of food is a persistent issue, with individuals rarely getting a meal a day[2][5][34]. When aid organizations provide food, competition is fierce, leading to major fights over the limited resources[7]. In displacement camps, the vulnerability of young girls is exploited, as they are coerced into trading sex for food[6][36]. Families like that of Judeline Auguste depend on remittances, but this money barely lasts a week, leaving them unable to provide food daily[5][8][40].

The psychological toll of this food insecurity is profound. Caregivers like St-Louis report feeling so depressed that they sometimes contemplate harming themselves and their children[41][42][43][44]. Judeline Auguste describes her hardship as particularly painful because of her son, who cries from hunger[42][44][46]. Jean Yonel echoes this sentiment, expressing his inability to provide for his children every day[46].

In an attempt to cope, some families rely on others to feed their children[34], and caregivers take their young children to clinics for a peanut butter mix to prevent malnutrition[35]. On days when they cannot afford a proper meal, Yonel's wife mixes flour with spinach to stave off hunger pangs[14][16]. Despite these efforts, the struggle to secure enough food remains a daily battle for many Haitian families.

### Urgent Humanitarian Needs for Displaced Families in Artibonite, Haiti

Following the attacks in the commune of Saint Marc, Artibonite Department, on October 3, 2024, a total of 6,270 individuals, comprising 1,281 households, were displaced[21][22][25][27][36][38][40][41]. Of these displaced individuals, 88% sought refuge with relatives or host families in the communes of La Chapelle, Montrouis, Petite Rivière de l'Artibonite, and Saint-Marc[11][12][13][14][25][27][36][38][40][41][44]. The remaining 12% found refuge in three separate sites[21][36][38][40][41][44]. Despite the significant number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) being hosted by families, the specific details of the support provided to these host families and the additional resources required to sustain these arrangements are not detailed in the available sources[11][12][13][14][28]. 

The municipalities of Verrettes and Saint-Marc host almost half of the IDPs in Artibonite[29]. However, the sources do not provide information on how host communities in the Artibonite Department are coping with this influx or what specific support mechanisms are in place to assist them. Furthermore, there is no clear information on the most urgent humanitarian needs in terms of shelter, food, healthcare, and WASH services for the displaced individuals[36][38][40]. 

Families with pregnant or breastfeeding women and/or children under five receive additional support to prevent malnutrition[1]. However, the sources do not specify the measures being taken to ensure the safety and security of the displaced individuals in these host communities[41][42][43][44].

### Haiti Displacement Crisis: Urgent Need for Increased Humanitarian Support

Host communities in Haiti are experiencing severe pressure on their resources, with the majority of households reporting significant challenges such as food shortages, overwhelmed healthcare facilities, and a lack of essential supplies in local markets. This situation has been highlighted by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) [1][9]. In response to these challenges, the IOM is actively collaborating with partners to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches those displaced, particularly in inaccessible areas like most of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince [11].

The displacement crisis in Haiti is particularly acute in the Grand Sud region, which alone hosts 45 percent of all displaced individuals in the country. Meanwhile, the capital, Port-au-Prince, is home to a quarter of the nation's displaced population [21]. The Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) of the IOM has documented displacement following attacks in the municipality of Saint Marc, located in the Artibonite Department [32]. In this area, there are 1,281 displaced households and 6,270 displaced individuals, with 750 individuals being accommodated at three new sites [31]. A total of 1,146 households and 5,520 individuals are situated on these sites, while others have sought refuge with host families [31].

The displaced individuals are spread across various locations, including the municipalities of Saint Marc, Montruis, La Chapelle, and Petite Riviere de l'Artibonite [32]. Specific communal sections hosting these individuals include 5e section Bocozelle, 4e Section Lalouere, 2e Section Bois Neuf, 6e section Charrette, 1re Section Deluge, 1re Section St Martin, and 4e Section Savane Roche [32][39]. Notable sites accommodating the displaced include Portail des Guepes, Ecole Nationale Antoinette Dessalines, Venotte Grande Rue- Rue Christophe, and DUCO Place Phillippe Guerrier [31][32].

Amidst this crisis, local and international humanitarian organizations are urgently calling for increased support to address the underfunding of the humanitarian response in Haiti [42]. The IOM has emphasized the need for greater international attention on the crisis and has urged the global community to enhance its support for Haiti's displaced populations and host communities [41]. Currently, less than 36 percent of the necessary funding for the humanitarian response in Haiti has been secured [42].

### Project HOPE Delivers Critical Aid Amid Escalating Violence in Haiti's Grand Sud

Project HOPE is actively providing essential health and humanitarian aid in Haiti's Grand Sud region, a response necessitated by the ongoing violence that has severely strained the local health care system[11][12]. This violence, largely driven by gang activities, has led to a significant 22% increase in internal displacement since June, as reported by the International Organization for Migration (IOM)[21][22][26]. Over the past seven months, more than 110,000 people have been forced to flee their homes due to these escalating threats[21][22].

### Haiti's Security Crisis: Urgent Need for Enhanced International Support and Funding

Haiti is currently grappling with an "unprecedented security crisis" that has persisted since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021, leaving citizens, particularly around Port-au-Prince, in fear of moving freely [5][8][15]. This instability has been exacerbated by armed groups severely restricting access to essential humanitarian aid, deepening the crisis for vulnerable communities who face severe shortages of food, water, shelter, and medical care, alongside severe protection risks [4][11][12][21][22]. Over 700,000 people have been forcibly displaced due to violence and insecurity, further highlighting the dire humanitarian needs [3][4].

Efforts to enhance security through the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission have been hampered by a "continued shortfall in funds, equipment, and logistics capabilities" [6][19][31]. Transforming the MSS into a peacekeeping operation under the United Nations mandate is considered necessary to ensure more stable and predictable financing and to expand the force's capacities [31]. The UN Secretary-General may offer logistical support to the mission, contingent on full financial reimbursement through available voluntary contributions [15].

Rights advocates have called for more support and training for Haiti's national police force, an end to corruption, and a Haitian-led political process [10][18]. The Head of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH), Maria Isabel Salvador, has engaged with key stakeholders, including Haitian officials and other UN agencies, although specific challenges faced by BINUH in coordinating with Haitian authorities are not detailed [1][10].

International partners are urged to increase funding, enhance security, and demonstrate international solidarity to overcome these obstacles [13][41]. UNHCR, through its Assistant High Commissioner for Operations, Raouf Mazou, has called for increased and urgent attention, support, and solutions for Haitians affected by violence and insecurity [43][44]. Mazou has witnessed the devastating impact of the security situation, where armed groups have severely restricted access to essential humanitarian aid, and heard about severe shortages of food, water, shelter, medical care, and protection risks [43][44][45].

UNHCR reaffirms its commitment to supporting Haitian authorities and the UN Country Team's efforts to address the protection and humanitarian needs of Haitians within the country and throughout the Latin American and Caribbean region [24]. This includes improving access to birth registration to ensure Haitians can exercise their rights and prevent statelessness [24]. Outside of Haiti, UNHCR continues to engage with governments and partners to ensure Haitians have access to protection and solutions [24].

Ultimately, Haiti's stability will be achieved through a multi-pronged approach that addresses the root causes of its challenges, with stable and predictable financing and expanded capacities for security forces being crucial [16][18]. The international community's collective support is essential to providing life-saving humanitarian assistance and restoring stability and hope in Haiti [41][45].

### Urgent Mobilization Needed to Protect Children and Address Health Crises in Haiti

Children in Port-au-Prince are increasingly targeted for recruitment by gangs, yet there is a lack of information on specific measures in place to protect them or the effectiveness of such measures. This situation is compounded by the anticipated above-average rainfall and temperature due to La Niña in eastern Haiti, which could lead to a rise in waterborne diseases, necessitating increased medical care for both displaced and host communities[1][21][22].

To address these challenges, a comprehensive mobilization of resources is required. Essential services include health, protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, along with primary health care, pharmaceuticals, and medicines. Promotion of sanitation and hygiene, including hygiene promotion and awareness-raising activities on hand hygiene, food safety, and waste management, is also crucial. Clean water sources and responses to extreme weather and health crises are needed, as well as training for frontline health workers[23][25][28][30].

Project HOPE is actively responding in departments such as Sud, Nippes, and Grand'Anse, focusing on increasing access to primary health care and protection services through mobile clinic activities and hygiene promotion[23][28]. Humanitarian organizations can enhance their response by addressing health, protection, and WASH needs, increasing access to primary health care, training frontline health workers, and providing pharmaceuticals and medicines. They also offer psychosocial support through Program Management Plus (PM) group sessions and follow-up services, strengthen mental health and gender-based violence (GBV) prevention resources by offering referral services, and distribute hygiene kits to internally displaced people (IDPs)[31][32][33][40].

The demand for increased medical care is anticipated due to potential rises in waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, salmonellosis, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever, as well as increased internal displacement and an increase in rape and other GBV in gang-controlled areas and IDP sites[34][41][42][47]. Healthcare services can be expanded by increasing access to primary health care, training frontline health workers, and providing pharmaceuticals and medicines. Project HOPE addresses extreme weather and health crises and utilizes mobile clinic activities to reach IDPs[43][45][47][50].

Humanitarian aid can be optimized through mobile response teams and flexible assistance modalities, including Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA). Organizations provide tailored in-kind assistance, distribute kits, and offer cash and voucher assistance. Support to civil society actors, such as community kitchens, can be expanded to increase their capacity to aid those on the move, and access to income generation sources can be supported. Mobile units are operated to address immediate needs, which is particularly relevant given that gang-imposed roadblocks hinder humanitarian access and can make food less available and accessible. Additionally, agricultural production has been below the seasonal average due to insecurity affecting access to land, seeds, and labor[51][52][53][54][57][59].

### Urgent Need for Enhanced Protection and Services for Displaced Women in Haiti

The Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, led by Kenyan police forces, is actively working to enhance public safety and protect critical infrastructure in Haiti, including the airport and essential roads[1][2]. This mission comprises around 400 personnel, with contributions from officers from Jamaica and Belize[3][4]. While there have been reports of improvements in the security situation[6], the specific impact of the MSS mission on overall security remains unclear.

In Haiti, the living conditions in displacement sites are dire, significantly increasing the risk of gender-based violence (GBV) for women and girls. These conditions are exacerbated by a lack of basic necessities, resources, food, and water[11][12][14]. Food insecurity, coupled with the scarcity and high costs of market products, heightens their vulnerability to violence, sexual exploitation, and abuse, forcing them to rely on harmful coping mechanisms[13][15]. Specific risks in these sites include inadequate sanitation facilities, with more than half of latrines and many showers not separated by gender, several showers lacking locks, and many sites without nighttime lighting[18]. Additionally, groups of armed men frequently attack women and girls as they travel to work or school[14].

To address these challenges, there is an urgent need for protection services, reproductive health services, shelter, food, water, sanitation, and hygiene for women and girls[13][15]. UNFPA and its partners are deploying mobile teams to internally displaced persons (IDP) sites to provide integrated sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and GBV services[13][16]. They also offer remote psychosocial support, referrals, case documentation, and GBV information via a hotline, alongside awareness-raising activities on GBV and SRH[13][16]. Four temporary women and girls' safe spaces are operational in these sites to fill gaps in psychosocial support and case management services[16]. Despite these efforts, protection services are not being delivered at the necessary scale, with only 15 out of 85 IDP sites in Haiti currently receiving such services[15][17].

The primary barriers preventing IDPs in the Metropolitan Area of Port-au-Prince (MAPAP) and other displacement sites from accessing essential protection services include limited service availability, insecurity and violence, poor living conditions, lack of resources and capacity, underreporting of GBV cases, and funding shortfalls[31][32][33][34][37][40]. Insecurity, marked by increased criminal incidents such as armed robberies, burglaries, and kidnappings, particularly in MAPAP, further complicates humanitarian access[33][34]. The lack of resources is evident, with only 3% of rape cases treated within 72 hours due to access constraints and inadequate facilities[37]. Additionally, a $674 million humanitarian appeal for Haiti has received just over a third of its funding, and UNFPA has mobilized only 19% of its required funding[34][40].

To mitigate these barriers, there is a need to increase service provision, improve security, deploy mobile and remote services, establish safe spaces, strengthen coordination and capacity, and conduct awareness activities[32][33][35]. Improving security conditions is a primary factor for households considering returning home[34][40]. The MSS mission continues to support the Haitian National Police in securing public safety and protecting critical infrastructure[38][39][40]. UNFPA and its partners are actively working to provide SRH and GBV services where access is possible and security allows[22][25]. Despite these efforts, the scale of current protection services remains insufficient[21][27].

Gang violence in areas such as Cit Soleil, Ganthier, and Bas-Delmas continues to drive displacement, with more than 700,000 persons internally displaced across the country[41][42][43]. Approximately 702,000 IDPs are in Haiti, with 37% in MAPAP[45]. The number of IDPs in MAPAP has decreased, reflecting a continued outflow of people to provinces, albeit at a lower volume compared to earlier in the year[45][46]. The ongoing displacement significantly impacts humanitarian needs, with displaced women and girls particularly affected by the crisis[43][44]. They struggle to secure even the most basic necessities, and the risks of sexual violence in displacement sites have risen due to poor living conditions[43][44]. Women and girls urgently need protection services, access to reproductive health services, shelter, food, water, sanitation, and hygiene[41][46]. Food insecurity and high market prices further amplify their vulnerability to violence, sexual exploitation, and abuse[41][46]. Currently, only 15 out of 85 IDP sites in Haiti receive protection services, including those for GBV survivors[45][46]. The lack of adequate sanitation facilities and nighttime lighting in these sites further exacerbates the risks[47]. Humanitarian access remains a challenge, impacting service provision in areas with risks of attacks and abductions[43][44].

### World Leaders Urged to Commit Resources for Haiti's Humanitarian Crisis Response

World leaders convening in New York for the United Nations General Assembly have a critical opportunity to address the dire situation in Haiti by making concrete financial, technical, and logistical commitments[1]. Such immediate and coordinated action is vital to improving the lives of millions of Haitians who are currently at risk due to one of the world's most severe humanitarian and security crises. In Haiti, approximately 300 violent criminal groups control nearly 80 percent of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince and are increasingly active in rural areas, severely impacting the nation's stability and security[1][16][22][26]. However, the specific nature of the proposed commitments remains unspecified.

In response to these challenges, Haiti is focusing on developing resilient infrastructure to enhance economic opportunities, particularly for the rural population involved in agricultural value chains, public service delivery, and urban mobility systems[12]. This includes constructing a hundred bridges to connect rural communities to public markets and essential services like health and education[12]. Significant road construction and rehabilitation efforts are underway in Les Cayes, facilitating quick access to humanitarian relief[12][19]. Despite these efforts, the sources do not explicitly detail how these infrastructure developments directly address vulnerabilities exacerbated by gang violence[14][16][17].

The World Bank Group is actively engaged in improving early warning systems, providing safe havens, and strengthening the government's emergency response capacity[11]. The new National Emergency Operations Center, partially funded by the International Development Association (IDA), aims to enhance coordination among at-risk populations before, during, or after climatic, geological, or other events[15]. Ongoing projects include the establishment of departmental and communal Emergency Operation Centers, construction sites for safe havens, and rural houses built through hands-on training in improved local construction techniques[15]. Additionally, Project HOPE is working to improve sanitation and waste management at hospitals in Les Cayes and Jeremie through targeted WASH repairs and rehabilitation works, including the construction of shower cubicles, installation of a sump pump and water tank, and rehabilitation of latrine blocks[19].

The Haitian Government is collaborating closely with the World Bank to restructure existing operations, aiming to deliver targeted and timely results on the ground[21]. The World Bank has adopted a strong rural focus, with over 80% of its programs implemented in more stable communities outside of Port-au-Prince, promoting access to sustainable basic services[21]. The World Bank supports the Haitian government in strengthening resilience and promoting the resumption of economic activities by financing key sectors and enhancing reliable access to basic services and livelihoods[21]. However, the sources do not detail how the restructuring specifically targets communities affected by gang violence[22][26].

Project HOPE addresses healthcare needs in the Sud and Grand'Anse departments by supporting five health facilities that provide primary health care services, including care for infectious and non-communicable diseases, sexual and reproductive health, clinical mental health, and GBV care consultations[31]. In August, Project HOPE staff treated 2,853 patients, addressing a range of health issues, including communicable and non-communicable diseases, injuries, mental health disorders, reproductive health services, and other health concerns[31]. In response to the need for mental health care, psychological support, and GBV prevention, Project HOPE conducted awareness-raising activities in the Sud and Nippes departments, reaching over 9,900 people with information on sexual harassment, domestic violence, physical violence, harmful traditional practices, and stress management[32]. Project HOPE also increased the number of mobile medical units (MMUs) from one to eight per week, doubling the number of patients assisted[33]. As gang violence persists, Project HOPE plans to continue providing medical supplies and essentials to MMUs and health facilities to strengthen the health system[31].

Among the patients served, 887 were internally displaced persons, with 284 identified as male and 603 as female[31]. However, the sources do not specify the exact services provided to these internally displaced individuals.

### WFP Emergency Aid and Education Initiatives Amidst Port-au-Prince Challenges

The World Food Programme (WFP) has been actively involved in providing aid through an emergency programme, reaching 93,715 people with 1,240 metric tons of food and assisting 79,220 people with USD 1.9 million in cash-based transfers (CBT) [1]. Additionally, WFP distributed 62,615 hot meals to 16,628 people, with a significant portion, 43,816 hot meals, allocated to 7,220 internally displaced people (IDPs) in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince [1]. Despite these efforts, the sources do not explicitly detail the impact of these distributions on food security for the 93,715 people reached or the 7,220 IDPs in Port-au-Prince.

In response to the closure of schools in Port-au-Prince, a summer camp programme was implemented, targeting four schools located in Cit Soleil Brooklyn, Drouillard, and Kenscoff [14]. This initiative aimed to provide educational activities during the school closure period.

The sources also mention the availability of online courses for children unable to attend school. However, these courses are only accessible to those who can afford Wi-Fi and a generator, which poses a significant barrier as most Haitians experience chronic power outages and spend a lot of time without electricity [31]. The sources do not describe any initiatives to provide access to these online courses for children lacking Wi-Fi and electricity.

Furthermore, WFP partners conducted screenings for 12,439 children, identifying 1,486 as moderately malnourished [41]. These children were referred to health facilities for treatment, although the sources do not provide information on the effectiveness of these referrals in treating the malnourished children [41].

### Urgent International Support Needed for Humanitarian Crisis in Pont-Sond, Haiti

Following the recent attack in Pont-Sond, Haiti, the region faces immediate humanitarian needs, including care for the injured and support for the medical system, which is overwhelmed, particularly the area's lone hospital. There is an urgent requirement for medical supplies to address these challenges [2][4]. The humanitarian crisis is further exacerbated by gender-based violence, including sexual violence, mass displacement, and extreme hunger, creating a dire situation for the population [3][4]. Support is critically needed for survivors of sexual violence and vulnerable children [1].

To effectively address these needs, increased international support and coordination are essential [1][21]. Aid organizations and other groups currently lack the necessary resources to tackle these challenges adequately [1][11][21]. Prioritization should focus on restoring state control and ensuring residents have access to basic necessities such as food, health care, and education. Additionally, rebuilding the justice system and implementing programs to support survivors of sexual violence and vulnerable children are crucial steps [1][11][21].

The transitional government requires significant resources to restore state control and ensure access to basic necessities, including food and health care [11][21]. The government, the Ministry of Social Services (MSS), and humanitarian and human rights groups in Haiti are currently under-resourced to effectively address these challenges [11][21]. More international support and coordination are needed to bolster these efforts [11][21].

The European Union condemned the violence in a statement on Friday, while the UN Human Rights Office of the Commissioner expressed horror at Thursday's gang attacks [22]. However, the sources do not provide details on how these entities are coordinating their efforts.

The mission will support the Haitian National Police in restoring basic security and state control, ensuring respect for human rights [31]. Prime Minister Garry Conille has vowed that perpetrators will face the full force of the law, emphasizing the need for their arrest, prosecution, and imprisonment, while victims should receive restitution [32][34]. The transitional government will need significant resources to implement programs supporting survivors of sexual violence and vulnerable children in areas controlled by criminal groups [31]. More international support and coordination are needed for these initiatives [31].

In response to the attack, Haiti's government deployed an elite police unit from Port-au-Prince to Pont-Sond. This unit will remain in the area as long as necessary to guarantee safety [52].

### Armed Gangs Disrupt Aid and Food Supply in Port-au-Prince, Haiti

Armed gangs exert significant control over Port-au-Prince, with estimates suggesting they dominate up to 90 percent[21] or 80 percent[26] of the city. This dominance severely disrupts humanitarian aid and food distribution, as gangs block road access, making it challenging for many organizations to deliver necessary aid[21]. For months, supplies from southern Haiti, a crucial area for food distribution, have been obstructed[21]. Consequently, the cost of food has surged due to trucks being compelled to pay exorbitant bribes to pass through[25][28]. Additionally, road closures between Port-au-Prince and the provinces hinder local farmers from buying and selling agricultural products in major markets[25][28]. This situation exacerbates hunger[23] and makes it difficult for people to access and afford nutritious food[21].

The sources indicate that gangs in Haiti are primarily armed with guns trafficked from the United States[33]. However, there is no information on how the Haitian government and international partners can collaborate to prevent this trafficking.

In response to an attack, Haiti's government deployed an elite police unit to Pont-Sondé, with assurances that the police will remain in the area as long as necessary to ensure safety[41]. Prime Minister Garry Conille emphasized that "the police cannot do it alone"[41][44], highlighting the need for community support. He also mentioned that security forces are "reinforcing their intervention" in the area[42]. Reinforcements have been sent to contain the situation, and security forces currently maintain control[43]. However, the sources do not provide specific strategies or recommendations for optimizing the deployment of this unit to achieve long-term safety and stability.

### Haiti Crisis: Urgent Need for Enhanced Support to MSS Mission

Haiti is currently grappling with a severe humanitarian crisis exacerbated by rampant gang violence, which has displaced over 700,000 people, more than half of whom are children[11][24]. This violence has not only disrupted daily life and forced people to flee their homes but has also led to acute food insecurity and the deaths of over 3,600 individuals this year alone, averaging more than 13 deaths daily[23][24][27][28]. The ongoing insecurity is paralyzing the economy, undermining institutions, and tearing apart the social fabric, resulting in widespread human rights violations and distress among thousands of families[21][24].

In response to this dire situation, the UN-backed Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, led by Kenya, was launched in late June to address the escalating violence and restore stability[17][23]. The mission's primary objectives are to quell gang violence, enhance national security, and establish conditions conducive to free and fair elections[14][21][24]. Initial successes have been reported, including the liberation of some communities and the securing of key infrastructure such as airports and oil terminals, achieved in collaboration with the Haitian National Police (HNP)[12][18][26].

The MSS mission has seen the deployment of approximately 400 to 600 Kenyan police officers, with plans to increase this number to 600 more between now and January[13][19][25][29][39]. Jamaican soldiers have also been deployed to support the mission[28][33]. Despite these efforts, the mission currently has only 410 officers, far short of its envisioned 2,500 personnel[26][34]. To effectively secure the country and facilitate social and economic reconstruction, the mission urgently requires substantial resources and increased international financial and logistical assistance[11][16][17][24][27][28][31][32][35][38].

While the MSS mission focuses on security, the sources do not detail specific strategies for directly assisting the displaced population, such as shelter, aid distribution, or resettlement programs[11][16]. The UN's migration agency has reported on the displacement numbers, highlighting the worsening humanitarian crisis, but further action is needed to address the needs of those affected[11][12]. The international community is called upon to bolster support for the MSS mission to ensure it can achieve its goals and help stabilize Haiti[31][32][35].

### Haiti Faces Severe Humanitarian Crisis: Urgent Need for Aid and Support

Haiti is currently facing a severe humanitarian crisis characterized by widespread food shortages, high inflation, and significant logistical challenges in delivering aid. In several communes, including Anse d'Hainault, Cap-Haïtien, Jacmel, Saint Jean du Sud, Aquin, Pestel, Chardonnières, and Anse Galets, shortages of wheat flour and rice have been reported, contributing to a variation in the cost of the food basket, which has increased by up to 16% in regions like Nord-Ouest and Sud[1][31]. This inflation is a major factor limiting access to food for displaced people, with food expenditure now accounting for up to 70% of total household expenditure[32][38][41].

The situation is exacerbated by logistical disruptions affecting the distribution of humanitarian aid. Airport closures between February and May, sporadic seaport closures due to security conditions, and violent attacks linked to armed groups have severely impacted shipping and airport operations, hindering the delivery of essential supplies[15][18]. Humanitarian organizations, including the International Organization for Migration (IOM), face challenges accessing communities in areas controlled by armed groups, further complicating aid distribution[18].

Over one million people in Haiti are expected to require treatment for malnutrition in 2024, with severe malnutrition being a primary challenge, particularly in the Sud department[26][40]. Displaced children in this region are unable to engage with humanitarian programs aimed at combating malnutrition due to limited healthcare access, especially in Port-au-Prince, where 40% of inpatient facilities have been closed since May 2024 due to insecurity[21][24]. The World Food Programme (WFP) is urgently calling for broad-based support to increase lifesaving assistance to families struggling with extreme food shortages and spiraling malnutrition[27][53].

Agricultural production in 2024 has been below the seasonal average due to erratic rainfall and insecurity affecting access to land, seed availability, and labor costs[41]. Food prices have risen by 40% since the beginning of 2024, driven by these supply chain disruptions and anticipated low production from the spring harvest[44]. Humanitarian food agencies and NGOs are facing a US$230 million shortfall to implement programs until the end of the year, highlighting the urgent need for financial support[27][41][53].

Specific needs in the crisis include increased humanitarian aid, particularly food and healthcare supplies, support to address food inflation, improved access to education for displaced children, and WASH services, as many lack access to clean water and sanitation systems[56][57][58][60]. There is also a need for mental health and psychosocial support, including psychological support for newly displaced children, and more health workers to ensure children can access proper care[59]. The IOM is prepared to distribute shelter kits, kitchen kits, and non-food item (NFI) kits, but logistical challenges remain[11][12][58]. Financial transfers, such as those provided by UN Women, which has transferred US$120 to each of 150 displaced households, are also crucial to support the increasing number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Port-au-Prince Metropolitan Area[43][51].

### Urgent Action Required: Addressing Escalating Hunger and Violence Crisis in Haiti

A coalition of leading humanitarian and development agencies, including Action Against Hunger, ActionAid, CARE, Mercy Corps, Concern Worldwide, World Vision, and Save the Children, along with the NGO platform CLIO, is urgently appealing to the international community to increase funding, ensure safe and unfettered humanitarian access for aid delivery, and ultimately find sustainable pathways to peace[1][2]. This urgent call to action aims to address the escalating hunger crisis in Haiti[3].

The situation in Haiti is dire, with gang violence significantly impacting the delivery of aid and food supplies[11][15][18][19][20]. Gangs control major roads, blocking essential food supplies[11], and the ongoing violence and security crisis prevent people from accessing and affording food[13][20]. Even when markets have food, the combination of violence and inflation has driven prices beyond the reach of millions[11][20]. The alarming rates of armed gang violence are disrupting daily life[16][17], and this trend is expected to continue, further affecting the supply chain[15]. Humanitarian and development agencies are urgently calling for safe and unfettered humanitarian access to ensure aid delivery[13].

The rise in food prices in Haiti is attributed to several key factors, including violence and security crises[22], inflation[22], and gang control of major roads[21]. These issues have made food unaffordable for millions[22], forcing heads of families to make difficult choices between feeding themselves or their children[21]. In some cases, women and girls are being coerced into offering sex in exchange for food[27].

Currently, 6,000 people in Haiti are classified under IPC Phase 5 Catastrophe[31][32][34], experiencing catastrophic levels of hunger and a collapse of their livelihoods[32][34]. These individuals face starvation[31], death[35], destitution[31], and extremely critical acute malnutrition levels[33]. Among them are internally displaced people living in temporary shelters in Haiti's capital[33], who are at the highest risk of malnutrition and diseases[35]. Women and girls in these vulnerable groups are particularly at risk, often forced to offer sex for food[35].

### Escalating Armed Gang Violence and Child Recruitment Crisis in ZMPAP Region

Since March 2024, the ZMPAP region has faced significant challenges due to attacks by armed gangs on critical government infrastructure, including prisons, police stations, the airport, and the seaport. These attacks have not only paralyzed the Government but have also severely limited the work of humanitarian responders in the area[2]. In response to the escalating violence and insecurity, a Kenyan contingent was deployed to Port-au-Prince in June to assist the Haitian police in their efforts to regain control of the capital[11]. Despite these efforts, the recruitment of minors into armed gangs appears to be increasing, as suggested by humanitarian responders following the deployment of the Kenyan and Jamaican MSS troops[14].

The growing influence of armed gangs has been identified as the primary cause of displacement in Haiti, contributing to heightened insecurity and violence[21]. However, the sources do not provide details on how humanitarian organizations are addressing the needs of displaced individuals and communities, only noting that their work has been constrained[24]. The forced recruitment of children into these gangs has had a detrimental impact on their safety, health, and development, posing long-term consequences for their future[31]. Children are recruited to bolster gang ranks and establish their legitimacy within communities[32]. They serve as key informants, gathering intelligence from the national police, Kenyan army, Jamaican army, and other armed groups, and are tasked with various duties, such as buying groceries[32].

While a Kenyan contingent was deployed to support the Haitian police[35], and a gang leader signed a peace treaty with the Government[33], the recruitment of minors is reportedly on the rise following the deployment of the Kenyan and Jamaican MSS troops[32]. The implementation of the peace treaty remains unclear, as violence continues to persist[33]. The sources do not provide information on specific strategies being implemented to combat the issue of forced child recruitment into armed gangs.

### Urgent Action Required: Addressing Child Malnutrition and Violence in Haiti

Between January and July 2024, severe acute malnutrition among children in Haiti surged by nearly 20%, with approximately 125,000 children affected by July[1]. This alarming situation is exacerbated by escalating violence[1], deep poverty[8], and political instability[4]. Compounding these issues are increased food insecurity, a cholera outbreak, and the ongoing hurricane season[6]. Access to humanitarian aid is severely restricted due to numerous checkpoints established by heavily armed gangs, particularly along National Roads 1, 2, and 3 in Port-au-Prince and Artibonite, which significantly limits the response to civilians, including children[8][11].

In response to this crisis, Save the Children is providing cash assistance to displaced families in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince and to host families in the Grand'Anse and South department[3]. The organization is advocating for full, unfettered access for aid workers and life-saving supplies across Haiti, especially in Port-au-Prince, to combat hunger and severe acute malnutrition[3][20]. Additionally, Save the Children is urging the international community to increase humanitarian funding for Haiti[3]. The Security Council is called upon to ensure the safe and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance to affected populations, including children, and to encourage donors to swiftly mobilize additional flexible funds to support the humanitarian response[10].

Child protection actors in Haiti face significant challenges in accessing and assisting children affected by armed violence, particularly those escaping armed groups. The presence of heavily armed gangs often prevents humanitarian assistance, especially in Artibonite and certain areas of Port-au-Prince[11]. There is a pressing need for sufficient child protection capacities[13] and for comprehensive information on separated and unaccompanied children, their needs, and the conflict's impact on their lives[15][20]. The call for urgent mobilization of resources and increased humanitarian funding for Haiti remains critical[14].
