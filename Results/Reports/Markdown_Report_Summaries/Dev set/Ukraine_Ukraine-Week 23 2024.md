# Ukraine-Week 23 2024 

## Summary 
Ukraine is experiencing a multifaceted crisis characterized by ongoing hostilities and significant humanitarian challenges. The Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS) continues to monitor the status of health facilities and identify service gaps[79], while nuclear safety and security, particularly at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), remain vulnerable with frequent external power outages and only one of four 750 kV power lines operational[28]. The country is still recovering from the Kakhovka Dam destruction a year prior, which resulted in devastating flooding, at least 15 deaths, damage to over 37,000 houses, and disrupted water supply for a million people[83]. Education activities in regions like Sumska, Donetska, and Kharkivska oblasts aim to restore normalcy for children amidst displacement and intensified missile attacks, with educational consultation points in Donetska oblast temporarily suspended and evacuations of families with children initiated in May 2024 due to worsening security[89][90]. Telecommunications infrastructure has also been severely affected, including a major cyberattack in December 2023 that disrupted mobile signals for millions, and temporary internet services were deployed in Odesa in May due to intensified shelling[49]. Economically, direct damage to Ukraine has reached USD 155 billion, with economic losses at USD 499 billion, and reconstruction efforts are estimated to cost over USD 486 billion[87]. Efforts are underway to address legal issues such as housing compensation[92]and provide mental health and psychosocial support to over 117,000 people[46], with calls for women's inclusive participation in reconstruction processes[5].

## Cluster Summaries

### Legal Barriers Impede Compensation for Destroyed Housing in Occupied Ukraine Territories

Owners of destroyed housing in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine face significant legal challenges that hinder their ability to receive compensation through the eRecovery program. One major issue is the difficulty in property registration. Most Bureaus of Technical Inventory (BTIs) in these areas were not relocated to government-controlled territories and have often been damaged, destroyed, or looted. This situation makes it nearly impossible to obtain the necessary information for state registration of property rights (SRPR), which is a precondition for applying for compensation through the eRecovery program[3][5][6][31][32][34]. The law mandates that state registrars obtain information from BTIs for state registration of rights, but this requirement becomes a significant barrier when BTIs are inaccessible[5][6][31][32]. Owners who acquired property before 2013 face additional challenges, as they struggle to register their rights in the SRPR even with hard copies of title documents, often necessitating a judicial procedure to recognize their ownership, which involves court fees and the burden of proof[3][4][6][8][34].

Inheritance issues further complicate matters, as notaries frequently refuse to open inheritance cases for properties in temporarily occupied territories, likely due to potential legal liabilities. This forces heirs to seek court confirmation of ownership in the order of inheritance, again requiring court fees and proof[8][9]. These legal hurdles directly impede an owner's ability to meet the SRPR registration requirement, which is essential for eRecovery compensation[4][6].

The eRecovery program itself is limited in scope, providing compensation only for housing destruction, as assessing damage levels via satellite images is not feasible[4][6]. Although there are plans to expand the program to other temporarily occupied territories, such as Mariupol and Bakhmut, these expansions depend on funding support. A draft law related to this expansion is currently registered in the Parliament and is preparing for a second reading[1][2][4].

In the broader context, services and housing stock in areas where the Government of Ukraine is regaining control are under stress due to increased demand, a situation affecting virtually every Oblast in the country[11]. These regions, previously under occupation and on the frontlines of war, have seen their infrastructure and services severely impacted[11]. Additionally, there has been a rapid increase in requests for technical documentation and cadastral numbers for horticultural land plots[21][22]. To address this, the legislator has initiated amendments to the Law on land plots allocation, extending the deadline for registering land ownership from January 1, 2025, to January 1, 2028[21][26]. These amendments, passed in parliament and awaiting the Presidential signature, aim to alleviate the backlog and prevent unregistered land from being considered free and sold by the state[21][26].

### Emergency Internet Services Deployed in Odesa; Zaporizhzhya Plant Faces Power Crisis

In response to an urgent request from local authorities in Odesa due to intensified shelling, the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) set up temporary internet connectivity services from May 7 to 8. These services were provided for registration points and tents opened by local authorities to support affected people. The ETC utilized its existing Remote Site on Vehicle (RSoV) and satellite solutions to deliver the service. By May 9, all community members were registered using the new network, and the ETC service concluded [1][2][3][5].

Meanwhile, the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) is facing significant challenges with its power lines and external power situation. The plant's electricity grid has been severely impacted by the conflict, leading to repeated losses of connections to all its power lines. The external power situation is extremely vulnerable and prone to frequent outages. Before the conflict, ZNPP had four 750 kV lines available, but only one remains, and this line is unavailable due to damage sustained earlier in the conflict, away from the site [21][22]. 

Regarding repair plans, the ZNPP is not currently planning to complete repairs at this time. These issues affect the plant's operations as a loss of off-site power has the potential to be more serious due to higher nuclear fuel temperatures for reactors in operation in Ukraine. Director General Grossi reiterated that the ZNPP would not be re-started as long as nuclear safety and security remained in jeopardy due to the conflict. However, IAEA experts were informed that nuclear safety and security is being maintained despite the ongoing conflict [21][22].

### Revitalizing Irrigation and Healthcare Amidst Kakhovka Dam Disaster in Ukraine

Efforts to revitalize irrigation systems are being examined to boost vegetable and fruit production, particularly in areas affected by the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in 2023[1]. This disaster has significantly impacted the healthcare system in southern Ukraine, especially for middle-aged and elderly populations who face challenges such as a lack of access to quality medicine, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and chronic diseases[11][17]. The healthcare infrastructure has been severely compromised, with healthcare workers in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions operating under dire conditions, including destroyed hospitals, a shortage of medical staff, and daily shelling[12][19][31][32].

In response to these challenges, various efforts have been initiated. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been providing medical and humanitarian aid since the Kakhovka Dam was destroyed on June 6, 2023, and continues to support the affected populations one year later[21][22]. MSF operates mobile clinics in the Kherson oblast region, addressing the mental health effects such as anxiety and sleep disturbances that communities are experiencing amidst the ongoing war[21][22][30]. The environment is marked by reminders of conflict, including destroyed buildings and warnings of mines[22].

Local initiatives have also been crucial. In the village of Virivka, Kherson, where the medical facility was destroyed and looted during the Russian military occupation, Ministry of Health nurse Olha Varenyk initially conducted medical check-ups in her home[31][32]. To better serve the community, a modular structure was recently installed in her yard, allowing her to continue seeing patients despite the challenging conditions[12][19][31][32]. The UN has also responded swiftly and continues to provide support[15].

These combined efforts aim to address the healthcare needs and improve the living conditions of those affected by the disaster, despite the ongoing challenges posed by the war and the destruction of critical infrastructure[11][12][14][19][22][31][32].

### Urgent Restoration Needed for Rafah Hospitals Amidst Flooding and Health Crisis

The partially functional field hospital in Rafah faces significant challenges, primarily due to its inaccessibility caused by hostilities in the area. This situation limits the hospital to providing only basic services to patients within its confines. The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the urgent need to restore hospitals in Rafah to improve access and functionality [1].

In a related humanitarian crisis, the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station led to severe flooding, deeply affecting residents emotionally. Many, like Olha Panich, are distressed, recalling how the flooding of lower streets, riverbanks, houses, and gardens forced people to relocate to higher ground [11][12][13]. In response to these challenges, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, has been actively providing medical services and medicines through mobile clinics in affected areas, including the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions [20]. These clinics are staffed by a dedicated team of doctors, paramedics, nurses, social workers, and psychologists [15].

In Novosofiyivka, Mykolaiv region, most residents seeking consultations at MSF mobile clinics are elderly women [21][24][30]. The health needs observed include cardiovascular diseases, prompting MSF health promoters to educate on prevention strategies. MSF doctors also monitor blood pressure and blood sugar levels, prescribing necessary medications [28]. The mobile clinics operate in local medical units, ensuring continued access to healthcare by utilizing a single bridge that remained unflooded, allowing MSF teams to reach patients on the other side of the river [21][22]. Supplies are also sent by boat from the village of Fedorivka, located across the river [21][22]. On the inaccessible side, MSF was the sole organization providing medical services and medicines at that time [23][29].

The flooding also caused a severe shortage of drinking water in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, as wells and boreholes were inundated [31][34]. To address this, MSF purchased large quantities of water and storage containers, distributing them to residents [34][38]. They also provided packs with water and water disinfectants, which residents transported by boat [35]. In communities along the Inhulets River, where all wells and boreholes were flooded, MSF faced challenges reaching the opposite bank [43][44]. Volunteers played a crucial role in transporting water, water disinfectants, and medicine kits by boat [41][42].

On the inaccessible side of the river, MSF remained the sole provider of medical services and medicines [51][55]. This shortage had serious health implications, as illustrated by a patient with dangerously high blood sugar levels, for whom no immediate medical help was available [54][56]. To mitigate these issues, MSF continued to distribute water and medical supplies, sending them by boat from Fedorivka [52][54]. They also relied on volunteers to transport essential packs across the river [55][56]. The MSF team utilized the unflooded bridge to maintain patient access to healthcare [52][54]. Their mobile clinics, staffed by a comprehensive team, continue to offer medical services, transport patients to hospitals, and support frontline hospitals with medical donations [51][60]. Despite these efforts, the sources do not specify additional resources needed beyond what MSF is currently providing.

### Insufficient Collective Centers and UXO Threats Challenge Sumy and Mykolaiv Regions

In Sumy, there are only 11 Collective Centers (CCs) available, which is deemed insufficient to accommodate the potential influx of internally displaced persons (IDPs) should the security situation worsen within a 20-30 km zone. This shortage has raised concerns among local authorities about their capacity to manage a growing number of IDPs if the situation deteriorates further [1].

Meanwhile, in the Mykolaiv region, eight HALO minefields along the Inhulets river were severely impacted by floods, which displaced unexploded ordnance (UXO) to new and unpredictable locations. This has introduced new explosive threats in areas where HALO teams had been actively working, leading to a cessation of operations in the affected areas for up to six months [21][31]. Despite the severity of the situation, the sources do not provide specific strategies on how the displacement of UXO is being addressed or how efforts are being prioritized to ensure civilian safety. Additionally, there is no information on how humanitarian organizations are coordinating with HALO teams to resume operations [21][31].

### Coordinated Health Efforts and Agricultural Challenges Amidst Kharkiv Displacement Crisis

Health Cluster partners, including the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Stellar Ukraine mobile teams, are actively coordinating efforts to provide health consultations to displaced people at the Kharkiv City Transit Center[1]. Meanwhile, Ukraine's agricultural sector faces significant challenges, particularly in the fruit and vegetable, dairy, poultry, and honey sectors, which receive less attention in terms of resource allocation[11][21]. Labor shortages further exacerbate production issues across these sectors[31]. To address these challenges, investments in adapting agricultural equipment for use by persons with disabilities (PWDs) are proposed as a solution to mitigate labor shortages and reduce unemployment among PWDs[21][31]. Additionally, the destruction of infrastructure due to ongoing conflict presents another formidable obstacle to agricultural production, though specific solutions to this issue are not clearly outlined in the provided sources[41].

### Ukraine's Reconstruction: Advancing Gender Equality and Climate-Resilient Economic Transformation

Ukraine is poised to leverage its reconstruction, estimated to cost over USD 486 billion, as an opportunity to transform its economy and society into a climate-resilient and inclusive model. This transformation aims to significantly contribute to Europe's economic growth and strategic autonomy through innovation, energy security, decarbonization, and diversified supply chains[1][3]. 

In the recovery efforts, organizations like CARE and JurFem are advocating for gender equality and the rights of gender-based violence survivors by emphasizing the importance of including Ukrainian women in the reconstruction processes. They call for the promotion of gender equality in all recovery efforts[11]. CARE stresses that the meaningful and direct participation of women, girls, and marginalized groups in decision-making is crucial for forming an equitable, inclusive, gender-responsive, and effective recovery agenda. They also advocate for protecting and ensuring equitable access to services and opportunities for women to rebuild their lives[14].

The Ukraine Recovery Conference 2024 is a platform where CARE welcomes the broader participation of Ukrainian civil society, including women's rights and women-led organizations. The conference aims to integrate gender perspectives throughout its proceedings[13][22]. CARE's presence at the conference ensures that economic support and inclusion in social programs for survivors are considered in discussions, decisions, and interventions[13].

JurFem, a partner organization of CARE, focuses on developing gender-oriented approaches in government and business, particularly in combating violence against women. Its Chairwoman, Khrystyna Kit, asserts that a just recovery is impossible without a gender component. JurFem emphasizes that strengthening the rights of gender-based violence survivors is essential, as psychological and medical support alone are insufficient[12]. 

The support for Ukrainian women's rights and women-led organizations, such as JurFem, at the Ukraine Recovery Conference 2024, aims to empower them to have a stronger voice in decision-making on reconstruction and recovery. This includes ensuring their participation and integrating gender perspectives throughout the conference[22][24].

### Geographical Contexts Dictate Emergency Response Priorities and Challenges in Crisis Zones

The document outlines how geographical contexts influence the prioritization of activities in specific locations, taking into account factors such as limited access, proximity to conflict zones, or emergencies following attacks[1]. The nature of crises is geographically specific, leading to the establishment of four distinct zones to guide expected interventions[7]. 

In these zones, Context 1 is characterized by areas that are frequently attacked, necessitating emergency activities to address immediate needs[7]. Conversely, Context 4 describes regions not under government control, where humanitarian access is severely restricted. In these areas, the capacity for needs assessment is very low, markets are non-functional, and last-mile distribution presents significant challenges[2]. 

While the document does not provide specific definitions or challenges for Context 2 or Context 3, it emphasizes the importance of monitoring and reporting the effectiveness of emergency construction materials and shelter kits (ECM and ESK) distribution. The indicators used for this purpose include the number of households, individuals, social facilities, and residential units supported with emergency shelter assistance[12].

### Enhancing URCS Capabilities in Cash and Voucher Assistance Through CashCap Integration

The embedding of CashCap experts within the Ukraine Red Cross Society (URCS) played a pivotal role in enhancing the organization's position and capabilities in Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA). These experts were instrumental in positioning URCS effectively in external coordination forums, notably the Cash Working Groups (CWGs), where URCS attained co-chair status. This achievement was facilitated by the experts' leadership and training efforts, which significantly contributed to URCS taking on more significant roles in external coordination structures and gaining visibility among donors and international organizations, thereby granting them CVA legitimacy as a large cash actor[1][2][4][11][12][13][14][20].

The experts' contributions extended beyond coordination, as they facilitated partnerships and collaboration with the government and other stakeholders. They provided expertise in coordination, capacity-strengthening, policy influence, and advocacy for quality CVA. This included enhancing CVA skills and competence within URCS, contributing to documentation development, and improving information management[11][12][18]. As a result, URCS gained a deeper understanding of its role with the government and became the sole partner of the Ministry of Reintegration and Occupied Policy since September 2022, handling registration, payment, Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM), and Community Engagement and Accountability (CEA)[13][15][20].

URCS also implemented a no-regret cash in envelope for 270,000 recipients for the Ministry of Reintegration and Occupied Policy and managed 100,000 recipients per month for host community members hosting Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)[15][20]. Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) were established with the government, further solidifying URCS's role and visibility[20].

Despite these advancements, perceived gaps remained within URCS, such as not being fully cash ready, a gap in understanding at the branch level, and the absence of sectoral cash[21][34]. To address these challenges, interviewees, particularly from National Societies, advocated for a more structured deployment with clearer objectives and increased involvement in expert selection. They proposed involving the National Society and CashCap directly in decision-making and Terms of Reference (ToRs) drafting, along with regular partner check-ins[30]. About half of the interviewees suggested a more structured approach for future deployments, emphasizing the importance of interpersonal skills and involvement in setting objectives and expert selection[30].

CashCap experts addressed these challenges by significantly enhancing CVA skills and competence in Ukraine through daily teaching, mentoring, collective capacity-building activities, and quality feedback and reporting. Their knowledge of cash coordination and extensive experience in CVA were crucial in facilitating these improvements[31][33][34]. The experts' leadership and training efforts were key in URCS attaining co-chair status in the CWG, further empowering the organization and enhancing its visibility[39].

### HeRAMS Identifies Critical Health Resource Gaps in Conflict-Affected Ukraine

The Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS) plays a crucial role in assessing the availability of critical health resources and services, particularly in conflict-affected regions like Ukraine. It aims to identify existing gaps and establish intervention priorities by monitoring the availability of essential services and the challenges impeding access to these services[1][2][11][12][18]. HeRAMS provides detailed reports on the status of health facilities, focusing on the availability of essential services and the challenges that hinder access[1][11]. The data collection process includes questions about factors that impede functionality, although the primary challenges are not explicitly listed in the sources provided[8]. Data is consistently collected and updated for all accessible public health facilities, with a stratified sample for verification based on the type of health facility, including Multi-Profile Health Facilities (MPHFs) and Primary Health Centers (PHCs)[18][31][32][35]. The healthcare facilities are selected randomly for this verification process[31].

Since the escalation of the conflict on February 24, 2022, attacks have damaged numerous health facilities in Ukraine[11]. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collects information on civilian harm from conflict-related violence using a wide range of sources, including interviews with victims, their relatives, and witnesses; open-source information; forensic records; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organizations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; and data from medical facilities and local authorities[23]. All sources and information are assessed for relevance and credibility and cross-checked[23]. Despite these efforts, the UN notes that the actual extent of civilian harm, including casualties and infrastructure damage, is likely considerably higher due to the large number of reports and the lack of access to relevant areas, particularly from the period immediately after the full-scale armed attack[22][25]. Requests by the UN to access Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation are consistently denied[22].

The UN has verified cases of harm, including the killing and maiming of Ukrainian children, with more than 600 children killed and 1,420 injured since the escalation of Russia's invasion in February 2022[21][22][27]. Children in frontline regions have spent the equivalent of seven months underground in bomb shelters due to relentless attacks[24]. In response, the UN works with the Government to provide the care these children desperately need[21]. Since the beginning of the war, over 117,000 people, including refugees, internally displaced persons, and host communities, have benefited from mental health and psychosocial support services in Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, and Georgia[25]. The Secretary-General officially listed Russia for the killing and maiming of Ukrainian children in 2023[21].

### Targeted Interventions and Psychosocial Support Efforts in Ukraine's Conflict Zones

The Multi-sector Needs Assessment (MSNA) data underscores the complex challenges faced by various demographic groups in Ukraine, highlighting the necessity for targeted interventions to address these diverse issues[1]. The assessment reveals that the intersection of the head of household's gender with other vulnerabilities exacerbates the level of need within households[1]. It encompasses aspects such as gender, disability, inclusion, displacement, and humanitarian needs[2]. This data is instrumental in prioritizing assistance based on specific household and individual characteristics, including female-headed households, disabled person-headed households, vulnerable older people, persons with disabilities, and children lacking caretaker or family support[1].

In Kharkiv, the Gender-based Violence (GBV) team took significant steps by distributing 197 dignity kits to women and girls evacuated from areas around Vovchansk and Lyptsi[11]. On June 4, an additional 18 dignity kits were distributed at a collective center for internally displaced persons (IDPs)[11]. A psychologist from the Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MPHSS) team assessed needs and provided psychological first aid, supporting 43 individuals[11]. Women and girls were informed about available psychosocial support and other services, and they were invited to visit a women's and girls' safe space in Kharkiv[11]. Furthermore, an International Medical Corps psychologist assessed needs and offered support to displaced people at a Kharkiv dormitory[11]. However, there is no clear information on the immediate and long-term impacts of these specific interventions in Kharkiv, nor on how these interventions might be scaled to other affected areas in Ukraine.

In Lviv, faith leaders, youth leaders, and volunteers who received Psychological First Aid training are set to apply the learned interventions upon returning to their communities[21][31]. This initiative aims to foster resilience and mental well-being at the grassroots level by training and supporting those most affected by the war[21][31]. The sustainability and effectiveness of this training are ensured as these leaders implement the psychological interventions to bolster community resilience and mental health[31].

### Strategic Measures for Safety and Security in Donetska Oblast Operations

In Donetska oblast, ensuring the safety and security of evacuees and humanitarian workers involves several strategic measures. Partners working or planning to work in the region are advised to switch to an online format or utilize mobile brigades in areas where offline activities could endanger beneficiaries. All activities must be conducted only in safe locations and contingent upon the security situation. Regular consultations with authorities are essential to assess the security conditions in various areas. Additionally, the heads of military administrations are responsible for pre-determining evacuation routes and ensuring the availability of transit hubs, although the specific challenges they face in this task are not detailed in the sources[1][21].

In response to the security challenges, online educational and wellbeing support is provided to children in locations such as Dobropillia, Druzhkivka, and Kramatorsk, particularly where the security situation hinders offline learning services[1]. Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is actively responding to Ukraine's requests for technical support and assistance to re-establish a robust nuclear safety and security regime at its nuclear facilities and in activities involving radioactive sources. The progress made by the Agency in these efforts is documented, although specific details of the technical support and assistance are not provided[11][32].

The implementation of safeguards in Ukraine, as outlined in the Agreement Between Ukraine and the IAEA for the Application of Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Protocol Additional thereto, is summarized in a report that highlights relevant aspects under the current circumstances[31]. The Director General has been requested to continue closely monitoring the situation regarding nuclear safety, security, and safeguards in Ukraine, with regular formal reports to the Board of Governors on these matters[32].

### Disability Households Show Higher Awareness of Child Violence Reporting Services

Households without a person with a disability generally reported being more aware of protection services, particularly state social services, than those with a member with a disability[6]. However, when it comes to specific services, households with a person with a disability demonstrated higher awareness in certain areas. For instance, they reported a higher awareness level, between 97% and 99%, regarding services for reporting cases of violence against children in the community, compared to 95% for households without a person with a disability[1]. Additionally, awareness of psychosocial support services was slightly higher in households with a member with a disability[1]. In contrast, when it came to accessing gender-based violence services available in Slovakia, 69% to 73% of households with a person with a disability reported awareness, which is slightly lower compared to the 73% reported by households without a person with disabilities[2].

### Education and Wellbeing Support Initiatives Amid Missile Attacks in Eastern Ukraine

In response to the disruptions caused by missile attacks and infrastructure damage in Kharkivska oblast, the Education Cluster has implemented activities to safeguard children's right to education[4][5][8]. These efforts focus on ensuring access to learning and wellbeing activities in safe spaces within Kharkiv city and oblast, particularly when online education is compromised due to increased missile attacks and damage to civil infrastructure, such as electricity and internet outages[1]. Key measures include supporting access to wellbeing and learning in safe spaces[7], providing education for school-age evacuees[8], and facilitating offline learning and wellbeing activities for both displaced and host community children to help them keep up with formal schooling and minimize learning losses[1]. Additionally, support is extended to teachers affected by escalations, displacement, increased workload, and challenges in supporting their students[1][11].

Specific initiatives include the provision of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) for children, incorporating social-emotional learning and informal education support[1]. Learning kits and electronic devices are distributed to aid learning[1], and safe spaces such as Temporary Learning Spaces and Digital Learning Centers are established for children to play and receive wellbeing and learning support[1]. Catch-up learning support services are also available to help children regain access to formal education[1], alongside wellbeing support services for teachers[1][11].

In Donetska oblast, as of May 29, 2024, the regional commission on technogenic and environmental safety and emergencies has mandated the evacuation of families with children from specific areas, including Lyman and several villages within the Lymanska, Hrodivska, and Illinivska hromadas[31][34]. This evacuation is coordinated with the Coordination Headquarters for mandatory evacuation under martial law conditions, with military administration heads tasked with planning evacuation routes and transit hub availability[31]. For evacuated children, wellbeing and educational support is provided in safe spaces[32][33][35]. Online learning access is maintained amid intensified missile attacks and educational infrastructure damage[32][33]. When security permits, offline learning and wellbeing activities are organized for both displaced and host community children to support their engagement with formal schooling and mitigate learning losses[32][33]. Teachers in Donetska oblast also receive support to manage the challenges posed by escalations, displacement, and increased workloads[32][38]. There is a recognized need for psychological assistance and rest for children traumatized by the war[31].

In Sumska oblast, tailored wellbeing and educational support services address the needs of displaced children by providing safe spaces for learning and wellbeing[45][47]. Online learning is facilitated amidst intensified missile attacks and infrastructure damage[41][45]. Offline learning and wellbeing activities are available for both displaced and host community children, contingent on the security situation, to help them remain engaged with formal schooling and reduce potential learning losses[42][45]. Teachers facing similar challenges due to escalations and displacement receive necessary support[43][45]. The criteria for determining when the security situation allows these activities to proceed are not specified in the sources[52][53].
