# UK riots-Week 32 2024 

## Summary 
The United Kingdom is currently experiencing widespread far-right riots, which were sparked by misinformation spread online regarding a stabbing attack in Southport that falsely identified the suspect as an immigrant and a Muslim[59]. These disturbances, which began on August 30 in Southport and escalated across towns and cities including Liverpool, Hull, Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, Sheffield, Sunderland, Middlesbrough, and Rotherham, involve racist attacks, looting, damage to public buildings, cars being set on fire, and assaults on police officers, Black, and Asian people[26]. Over 400 arrests have been made, with dozens of police officers injured, and some rioters have already received jail terms[37]. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned the events as "far-right thuggery" and vowed to bring those responsible to justice, including those spreading false information online[80]. In response, thousands of anti-racism protesters have taken to the streets across the UK, often outnumbering would-be rioters and helping to calm fears of extreme-right disorder[75]. Despite this, police remain on alert for further unrest, particularly targeting immigration centers, lawyers, and services, and Muslim and minority ethnic communities continue to feel fearful[68]. The UK government has also criticized Elon Musk for "deeply irresponsible" comments on social media regarding a potential "civil war"[88].

### Urgent Need for Regulation of Facial Recognition Technology in UK Policing

Facial recognition technology, particularly when used by law enforcement, raises significant concerns due to its intrusive nature and potential for complete societal surveillance[2][21]. This technology, which gathers facial images en masse from CCTV cameras, passport databases, and the internet, is capable of capturing everyone who passes by in public spaces[1][2]. The deployment of live facial recognition (LFR) in real-time settings can lead to significant injustices, primarily due to the increased risk of false positive matches, where individuals are incorrectly identified and flagged to police or security staff[2][21]. This misidentification is exacerbated by the "human dangers of believing in the infallibility of the machine," which has already led to errors[4][5][23].

The legal framework surrounding the use of facial recognition technology is notably lacking. There is no specific law governing how police or private companies, such as retailers, are authorized to use this technology[2][21]. It has been implemented on UK streets without significant public debate or parliamentary authorization, contrasting with regulated powers like telephone taps or DNA retention[1][22]. This absence of regulation creates a "legal black hole," with the police and government remaining silent on the issue[6][21][26]. The situation is further complicated by "unaccountable contracts for intrusive technology that replaces legal code with opaque computer code," highlighting the need for a parliamentary process and primary legislation to regulate these technologies[6][21]. Unlike Europe, which bans live facial recognition except in extreme circumstances, the UK lacks similar restrictions[2][5][23]. Despite these concerns, Keir Starmer has pledged to increase the use of live facial recognition technology[24].

The broader implications of this technology extend to democratic accountability and social cohesion. The government's approach to facial recognition has been criticized as casual with both the law and the allocation of public funds to private contractors[22]. This lack of accountability and transparency in the use of such intrusive technology poses profound implications for democratic processes[4]. Additionally, the need for a proper social cohesion strategy is underscored by the fact that most of the 2011 riots occurred in areas with low social cohesion[11]. Extremists exploit disinformation and conspiracy theories to provoke and attract individuals online, complicating efforts like the Prevent programme aimed at preventing radicalization[11]. However, the sources do not provide specific strategies for improving social cohesion or addressing the underlying issues of misinformation and extremism, beyond acknowledging the challenging context[19]. The use of LFR is seen as a dangerous and poor substitute for intelligence-led community cooperation and policing[26].

### UK Government Tackles Far-Right Riots Amidst Civil Liberties Concerns

The UK government is currently navigating the complex task of balancing law enforcement with the protection of civil liberties amid recent riots and protests. While protest is not illegal, and the rights to freedom of expression and assembly are protected under the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), to which the UK is committed, police intervention becomes lawful when an assembly turns violent or engages in unlawful acts[5]. The police strategy aims to facilitate peaceful protests while taking a firm stance against individuals intent on committing public order or criminal offenses, with a clear message that violence and hate will not be tolerated[3][5].

The government faces additional challenges in implementing policies that are both effective and humane, satisfying both sides of the political spectrum[3]. Criticism has been directed at the government for its handling of the crisis, including accusations of failing to adequately address issues affecting Muslim communities and not confronting racism directly[5][8].

Social media platforms have significantly contributed to the organization and escalation of far-right riots in the UK by spreading racist and Islamophobic misinformation[11]. False information about a stabbing incident, including incorrect claims about the suspect being an immigrant and a Muslim, was widely disseminated on social media[18]. Far-right groups exploited these platforms to falsely assert that the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker, with such misinformation being amplified by platform algorithms even after police clarified the suspect's identity[12]. Lists of target addresses for far-right protests circulated on Telegram and other social media channels, with messages encouraging attendees to "mask up"[11][16][17]. Policymakers are urged to focus on how easily these platforms can be used to promote hate, with calls for accountability from figures like Elon Musk, whose management of X (formerly Twitter) has been criticized[11]. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has also issued warnings to those inciting disorder online[15].

In response to the violence, local communities across the UK have overwhelmingly condemned the riots[22]. Anti-racist demonstrators have significantly outnumbered potential rioters, with thousands taking to the streets to counter far-right rallies[24][30]. This "show of unity from communities together" has been credited with overcoming the challenges posed by the riots[29]. For instance, a large counter-protest in Walthamstow demonstrated that strong community support can diminish the presence of those inciting violence[25]. Anti-racism rallies have successfully "stolen back the narrative and kept away far-right antagonists," showing solidarity with people of color and Muslim communities[25][26]. However, reports of violent counterattacks in some areas have also emerged[28].

Prime Minister Keir Starmer has emphasized the government's primary duty to ensure community safety, stating that necessary support is being provided where needed[21][22]. A "markedly stronger police presence" has been observed during counter-protests, with nearly 4,000 additional officers deployed[22][24]. A government order has granted officers special powers in certain areas to disperse gatherings or address "antisocial behaviour"[25]. Riot police are expected to remain on standby for the foreseeable future[21].

The government has prepared 6,000 specially trained police officers to respond to any disorder[31][35]. Although police across the UK were braced for widespread unrest, these demonstrations did not materialize as anticipated, largely due to the presence of police and counter-protesters[35]. Protests and counter-protests were reported to be largely peaceful[35]. Commissioner Mark Rowley of London's Metropolitan Police Service noted that the "show of force from the police," combined with community unity, effectively addressed the challenges faced[32][35]. The threat of extreme-right disorder has been mitigated, and fears of further unrest have subsided for now, thanks to the strengthened police presence[34][37]. British authorities have commended the police for their efforts in curbing a potential wave of far-right demonstrations[35].

### UK Government Addresses Social Media's Role in Inciting Riot Violence

Social media has significantly influenced the spread of information and misinformation during the UK riots, with platforms like X, owned by Elon Musk, coming under scrutiny for their role in this dynamic[2]. Musk faced criticism for his "unacceptable" and "deeply irresponsible" comments, including a prediction of an inevitable British "civil war" and the amplification of anti-immigrant rhetoric, which underscores the impact of false information in inciting real-world violence[1][2]. He further fueled controversy by repeating conspiracy theories, such as the "two-tier" claim that police are hesitant to confront violent Muslim demonstrators[4], and by posting an image suggesting future punishment for Facebook comments disliked by the UK government[2]. Additionally, Musk shared a tweet that compared the treatment of alleged rapists with false information, prompting a speaker at a counter-protest to accuse him of "stirring the pot for a race war"[4][10].

In response to the riots, characterized by real-world violence including the destruction of public buildings, arson, and assaults on police officers[11], the UK government has committed to holding accountable those responsible for the unrest and their "online cheerleaders"[1]. Neil Basu, former head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, remarked that some of the rioting had "crossed the line into terrorism"[13]. Police officers have recounted harrowing experiences, such as attending a "mass stabbing of little girls" and facing brick attacks while in riot gear[15].

Amid these events, a 28-year-old man from Leeds, northern England, became the first individual charged by the UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for using "threatening words or behavior intending to stir up racial hatred" online, with the charges linked to "alleged Facebook posts"[11][21][28]. This case highlights the government's stance on the role of online misinformation in exacerbating violence, as they strive to bring both the rioters and those inciting violence online to justice[21]. A UK government minister specifically condemned Musk's comments as "unacceptable," reflecting the broader concern over the influence of social media in these tumultuous events[2].

### British Government Forms Specialist Police Unit to Address 2024 Riots

The British government has announced the formation of a "standing army" of specialist police to address the ongoing issue of rioting, as it struggles to quell the unrest that has emerged in recent times[1]. Despite the challenges, the prompt arrest of many rioters, with some already sentenced to long prison terms, has had a deterrent effect[2]. Additionally, serious offenses carrying heavy maximum sentences may also contribute to this immediate deterrence[4]. However, the scale of the current unrest remains much smaller than the England riots of 2011[2].

A significant factor contributing to the unrest is the high level of poverty in certain areas, such as Sunderland, where 35 percent of children live in poverty, a figure notably higher than the national average of 29 percent[11]. This disparity highlights the wider inequalities and high levels of deprivation in cities and towns, which some sources suggest have fueled the unrest[13]. In 2024, Britain is recognized as one of the most unequal societies in Europe[11], with "deep-rooted inequalities" in housing, education, and wealth exacerbated by the cost of living crisis[12]. These conditions have led some to believe that people experiencing grievances project negative feelings onto an "other," using these grievances as an opportunity for violence[15].

Contrastingly, other sources argue that the riots of 2024 were not driven by "legitimate grievances" related to poverty, underinvestment, and the breakdown of basic services[18]. Instead, they claim that the motivations behind these riots were rooted in racism and nativism[17], marking a fundamental difference from past protests that were against poverty[12]. This divergence in perspectives underscores the complexity of the issues at hand and the multifaceted nature of the unrest.

### London's Community Response to Racism and Islamophobia: Strengthening Safety and Unity

To ensure the safety and well-being of Muslims and minority ethnic communities, several measures have been proposed. Londoners are encouraged to check on their friends and neighbors, showing care and compassion, as part of a broader effort to foster community support and resilience[1][2]. London maintains a zero-tolerance policy for racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism, or any form of hate, with assurances that those involved in disorder will face the full force of the law[1][2][13][19][24][57]. 

In the UK, Nigerians are urged to counteract online rhetoric spread by "racist hoodlums" and far-right influencers, preventing the dissemination of their divisive messages[8][58]. Communities are called to rally against the far right, supporting one another with kindness, love, and compassion, and to safeguard the most vulnerable among them[1][10][52]. This includes highlighting the resistance of Muslim women and acknowledging gendered Islamophobia as a specific form of violence against women and girls, which requires recognition at the highest levels of government[5]. Specialist services are urged to advocate for the safety of Muslim women and girls, and citizens are encouraged to stand up to racism and Islamophobia, pushing back against divisive rhetoric[5][56].

Despite these efforts, there are concerns about the role of the police, who are accused of being part of the problem due to allegations of Islamophobia, misogyny, and racism within their ranks[12][21]. While some praise the police for their efforts to maintain safety, as seen in Peterborough where the MP thanked the police, faith leaders, and the city council for their work[14][22], others argue that relying solely on law enforcement is insufficient[21]. The presence of police in riot gear during violent confrontations, where anti-fascist protesters were overwhelmed by far-right mobs, has left many Muslims and minority ethnic communities feeling scared and fearful, with some afraid to leave their homes due to attacks and beatings[23][26][27].

To address these challenges, community leaders and organizations are encouraged to engage in dialogue, such as opening mosque gates to facilitate discussions with members of the far right, fostering understanding through human interaction[31][36]. They can also counter extremist narratives by condemning ongoing violence, lobbying the government, and working to prevent future rallies that could incite further violence[52][55][60]. Faith leaders, the police, and city councils are urged to collaborate in keeping everyone safe and rejecting hate[54].

Ultimately, the emphasis is on communities coming together to support each other, demonstrating shared humanity through kindness and understanding[52][55]. Londoners are asked to show care and compassion to their friends and neighbors, reinforcing the city's commitment to zero tolerance for hate[57].

### Escalating Far-Right Protests in UK Towns: Social Media's Role and Risks

In towns such as Southport, Sunderland, and Stoke, hundreds of rioters were mobilized through social media, challenging Britain's peaceful multi-ethnic identity[1]. These protests were often planned organically by local people connected to decentralized far-right networks online, illustrating how modern technology, particularly social media, enables individuals to collaborate towards common political goals independently of traditional organizational structures[2]. Social media posts claiming action in many locations appeared to instigate these events, with misinformation about how the state handles unrest risking further tensions[1][6]. Following a stabbing in Southport, a broadcast channel titled 'Southport Wake Up' was set up on the messaging app Telegram, highlighting how the far-right now uses interlinked networks and Telegram chats to move seamlessly between groups, driving these protests[4]. Nigel Farage's manipulation of social media also contributes to the merging of different far-right elements, further complicating the situation[5].

The spread of misinformation online is a factor that needs to be examined, as it plays a significant role in these developments[8]. Ineffective legislation permits pernicious racist narratives to be freely propagated, especially on social media, which needs to be addressed in extremism laws[3]. The mainstreaming of far-right discourse on immigration is a political fact requiring a response to defend Britain's multicultural society[3]. By adopting far-right rhetoric, politicians have normalized Islamophobia and xenophobia, emboldening extremists and leading to a divided country where the far right is a real and present danger[10]. There is a pressing need for a more serious approach to integration, social cohesion, and counter-extremism, as these issues have been neglected[9]. Building a resilient multi-ethnic society requires concerted work on societal cohesion and greater responsibility and accuracy from journalists and politicians when discussing immigration, asylum seekers, and the Muslim community[8].

### UK Riots: Law Enforcement Challenges, Government Response, and Community Impact

Law enforcement agencies in the UK have faced significant challenges in managing recent riots, with numerous police officers injured as rioters targeted them with stones, petrol bombs, wooden planks, and fire extinguishers in areas like South Belfast and Rotherham[2][7]. Public opinion on the police's use of force is divided, with a slight majority believing the police are handling the riots well, yet confidence in their ability to prevent further violence remains low[3][4]. The perception of "two-tier policing" has become widespread, exacerbated by misinformation on social media that has played a prominent role in inciting violence[7][8].

In response to the unrest, the UK government and law enforcement have implemented several strategies. Over 3,000 people have been arrested, including 428 men in the UK, with courts denying bail for those awaiting trial and introducing emergency legislation to keep courts open 24 hours[4][8][11][15][20]. Sentences have been 25 percent higher than usual, with some jail terms as severe as three years[4][8][15][20]. Authorities are also using facial recognition and other technologies to track down suspects[12]. Sir Keir Starmer has taken a strong stance, warning that rioters and those inciting violence online will face "the full force of the law"[3][5][6][11]. The government has deployed a "standing army" of 6,000 specialist police officers to respond to violence[2], and mosques are receiving "greater protection with new emergency security"[2][11][24]. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has coordinated the crisis response through COBRA emergency response committee meetings, describing the situation as "far-right thuggery"[2][11][13].

Despite these measures, public satisfaction with the handling of the crisis is low, with only 31% approving of Keir Starmer's response and 23% approving of Home Secretary Yvette Cooper's efforts[11][19]. The riots have significantly impacted minority communities, particularly Muslims and asylum seekers, who have faced fear and direct attacks, including smashed windows of hotels housing asylum seekers and mosques pelted with rocks[32][34][36]. These incidents have left many feeling unsafe, with reports of racist and Islamophobic attacks, including stabbings and street beatings[33][35]. The circulation of target lists has further heightened fear within these communities[31][35][38].

Community cohesion has also been affected, with xenophobic and bigoted views becoming more normalized, threatening Britain's diversity and sense of belonging for some Muslims[33][34][38]. Despite these challenges, there have been positive displays of unity, with communities coming together to clean up after attacks and participate in anti-racism demonstrations[31][38]. However, the government lacks a framework to measure community cohesion or an evidence base on effective strategies, and economic hardship continues to undermine these efforts[31]. The events have left minority communities with traumatic memories to process, but they have also sparked an outpouring of goodwill and solidarity against racism and thuggery[31][36][38].
