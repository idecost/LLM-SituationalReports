# Sudan conflict-Week 34 2024 

## Summary 
Sudan is currently facing a severe humanitarian crisis marked by an ongoing 16-month civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has resulted in over 10 million displaced people and at least 18,000 deaths[7]. As of July 2024, famine is ongoing in Zamzam camp near El Fasher, with the city itself under RSF siege, and many other areas across Sudan remain at risk of famine, affecting over 25 million people or about half the population[1][39]. The country is also battling widespread health emergencies, including a confirmed cholera outbreak in Kassala and other states as of July 2024, with 11,327 cases and 316 fatalities reported by WHO, and at least 12 of 18 states experiencing multiple simultaneous outbreaks[39]. Humanitarian aid delivery is significantly hampered by heavy rains and floods, which have affected nearly 143,000 people, displaced at least 27,000, and left over 50 World Food Programme (WFP) trucks carrying aid for 500,000 people stranded due to impassable roads[40]. Despite these challenges, the Adre border crossing from Chad into Darfur, previously closed for six months, was reopened in August 2024, allowing WFP and International Organization for Migration (IOM) aid convoys to deliver supplies for tens of thousands, with WFP having additional supplies for 500,000 people ready to move through this critical route[19][30][31][43][45]. Meanwhile, Sudan's military-controlled sovereign council is engaging in diplomatic efforts, sending a delegation to Cairo for discussions with American officials regarding peace talks[8].

## Cluster Summaries

### Sudan Conflict: Humanitarian Crisis Escalates Amid Aid Delivery Challenges

The conflict in Sudan has resulted in the destruction of over 6,000 homes and damage to more than 10,000 others, leaving nearly eight million Sudanese internally displaced. Approximately half of these displaced individuals are being accommodated by friends, family, or strangers, underscoring the critical role of local communities in providing refuge[2][3][11]. The displacement has led to significant challenges, including the loss of livelihoods and access to farmland, which has exacerbated hunger and food shortages[10]. Many displaced people are also stranded, unable to reach their final destinations due to a lack of resources[3].

Local and national humanitarian organizations are pivotal in addressing the needs of these displaced populations. Emergency rooms, charitable organizations, and local committees are actively providing daily meals and medical care, while communal kitchens in Khartoum offer meals and emotional support to hundreds of thousands[12][15]. Since January, approximately 150 humanitarian organizations, including national NGOs, have reached nearly eight million people with some form of humanitarian aid[15]. Despite these efforts, the organizations face significant challenges, including administrative and bureaucratic hurdles imposed by warring parties[12]. Humanitarian workers and volunteers are at risk of threats such as arrests, prolonged investigations, and restrictions on movement. They also face systematic targeting and confiscation of aid, with at least 22 Sudanese national aid workers killed and 34 wounded or injured[12][15]. Female aid workers are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, which has been weaponized by warring factions[12]. The lack of safety and security is a major concern, as international humanitarian law is not respected, leading to potential attacks without warning[17]. Restrictions on civil society organizations and grassroots committees have severely hampered their ability to gather information, assess situations, and call for assistance, while communication blackouts further limit capabilities and hinder access to funding via banking applications[12]. The Sudan humanitarian appeal, seeking US$2.7 billion, is only 33 percent funded, constraining the response efforts of national NGOs[15]. Obstruction of aid delivery by militias and inaccessible main supply routes prevent the delivery of necessities like food and medical supplies, with the rainy season further complicating access due to heavy rains and flash floods[15][17].

In response to these challenges, the health ministry is working to deliver chlorine and implement sanitary procedures, although specific problems remain unspecified[21][29]. Meanwhile, a new initiative's roadmap, containing 10 key points, was presented to the leadership of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) 22nd Infantry Division in Babanusa and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) leadership in West Kordofan, based in Al-Fulah. The Commander of the 22nd Infantry Division, Hassan Darmot, and the RSF advisor in the region have expressed strong support for the initiative, with military parties responding positively and expressing goodwill[31]. While formal talks have not yet occurred, the next steps involve setting official meeting dates between the initiative's delegation and the leadership of the SAF 22nd Infantry Division and RSF, although no formal results or agreements have been achieved yet[31].

### Cholera Outbreak in Sudan: Urgent Response and Vaccine Shortage Challenges

The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 11,327 cases of cholera in Sudan, resulting in 316 fatalities[1]. The outbreak is primarily concentrated in eastern Sudan's Kassala, with the most affected areas being Wad El Helew, Kassala city, and Khashm El Girba, reporting 176, 126, and 81 cases respectively[31][32][33]. The cholera epidemic has been attributed to poor environmental conditions and contaminated drinking water[11]. In response, the Sudanese Ministry of Health, in collaboration with WHO, UNICEF, and state health ministries, has launched an extensive campaign to combat the outbreak[5][14][21]. This campaign includes a cholera vaccination initiative in Wad El Helew, targeting 51,000 people[13][31]. However, the vaccines quickly ran out due to the high number of displaced individuals, prompting health officials to call for additional supplies[40].

In addition to addressing the cholera outbreak, WHO has summarized the multi-country health situation and its response to the regional emergency caused by the conflict in Sudan[4]. The organization has also warned of an increase in dengue and meningitis cases as a consequence of the ongoing civil war[1]. The Federal Emergency Operations Centre is actively involved in tackling the cholera epidemic through its extensive campaign, which emphasizes cooperation with various health organizations[21]. Dr. Haitham Mohammed Ibrahim, a leading official, has been instrumental in announcing and coordinating these efforts[14].

### Cholera Outbreak Threatens Displaced Communities in Sudan's Refugee Areas

A new wave of cholera in Sudan is posing a significant threat to displaced communities throughout the country, with particular concern for its spread in areas hosting refugees, especially in Kassala, Gedaref, and Jazirah states[1]. Despite the severity of the situation, the sources do not provide details on the steps being taken to address this cholera outbreak[1].

### RSF Supports Adre Border Opening to Enhance Humanitarian Aid in Darfur

The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) Civil Administration in South Darfur State has expressed support for the opening of the Adre border crossing, as announced by Mohamed Ahmed Hassan, the head of the state's civil administration. He emphasized the RSF's readiness to forge strong partnerships and facilitate the operations of humanitarian organizations aiming to provide services and assistance to the residents[1].

The backdrop to this development is the ongoing civil war in Sudan, which has persisted for approximately 16 months[13]. This conflict has precipitated severe humanitarian consequences, including a massive hunger crisis affecting more than six million people in Darfur and over 25 million, or about half the population, across the country[11][14]. The World Food Programme (WFP) and other aid organizations have sounded alarms about an impending famine, attributing it to the civil war, displacement, and constraints on humanitarian access[12][13]. More than a dozen areas in Sudan are either experiencing or are at risk of famine, with reports of deaths, particularly among infants and young children suffering from acute malnutrition[12][16][19].

The conflict has also led to the largest refugee crisis globally, with over ten million people displaced or forced to flee, many of them multiple times[13]. Additionally, the power struggle has resulted in nearly 15,000 deaths[13]. The RSF's commitment to facilitating humanitarian efforts is crucial in this context, as it aims to alleviate some of the dire conditions faced by the population[1].

### WFP Implements Alternative Routes to Overcome Sudan's Logistical Challenges

To sustain the flow of food and nutrition assistance into Sudan, the World Food Programme (WFP) is implementing several strategies to overcome significant logistical challenges. One of the primary strategies involves using alternative and longer routes, such as the Tine crossing through Chad into North Darfur, and navigating long, dangerous paths from Port Sudan that cross battle frontlines and areas controlled by different militia groups to reach communities in Darfur[1][2][3][5]. The closure of the Adre route in February necessitated this shift, although WFP managed to send two convoys through Adre in March and April[31]. Recently, a newly re-opened route has been utilized to facilitate the swift movement of supplies, with food and nutrition provisions ready for around 500,000 people[3][38].

WFP is scaling up its food assistance efforts, aiming to support up to 8.4 million people by the end of the year in 14 areas either experiencing famine or at risk of famine, primarily located in Darfur, Kordofan, Khartoum, and Gezira[1][2][3][5][6]. In Khartoum, where truck access is particularly challenging, WFP has adopted alternative delivery methods, including mobile money, cash vouchers, and support for community kitchens to provide hot meals[7][21]. These measures are crucial as it is difficult for WFP food aid trucks to safely reach the capital[21].

The delivery of humanitarian aid in Sudan is further complicated by severe flooding, which has stranded more than 50 trucks carrying an estimated 4,800 metric tons of WFP food and nutrition assistance across various locations in Sudan[11][17]. The rainy season exacerbates the situation, as floods force more people from their homes, increase humanitarian needs, and cut off communities from vital assistance[11]. Heavy rains have destroyed key bridges, making it extremely difficult for aid convoys to navigate the muddy, flooded roads[11]. Nearly 143,000 people in 12 of Sudan's 18 states have been affected by the floods, with 50 fatalities and at least 27,000 people displaced[11]. The threat of waterborne diseases such as typhoid and cholera looms over malnourished children and women[11]. Some forecasts suggest that the flooding could surpass the historic 2020 floods that impacted Khartoum[11].

Despite these challenges, UN humanitarians continue to engage with Sudanese authorities to facilitate additional trucks for a constant supply of humanitarian goods[6]. However, the provided sources do not clearly state specific measures being taken to address the challenges posed by these floods.

### Sudan Conflict Escalates: Civilian Casualties and Humanitarian Crisis Intensify

The conflict in Sudan, particularly in North Darfur, has resulted in severe civilian casualties and extensive damage to infrastructure and livestock due to Sudanese army airstrikes. In Al-Koma, a town 75 km from El Fasher, airstrikes tragically killed a woman and her four children. They succumbed to their injuries at Al-Koma Rural Hospital, which lacked the necessary equipment to save them. Additionally, the airstrikes devastated sheep pastures on the outskirts of Al-Koma, killing over 150 livestock. Eyewitnesses reported that these attacks targeted only civilian areas, sparing any Rapid Support Forces (RSF) gathering points[1][2].

Further airstrikes in the Abu Hamira area of Umm Kadada, 168 km east of El Fasher, involved two Sukhoi planes firing shells near a water station in the Telis area. The army also launched air raids on Al-Tawisha in North Darfur, resulting in numerous civilian casualties[1][2]. The ongoing conflict has severely impacted civilian infrastructure, with over 75% of health facilities in conflict-affected states rendered non-functional. Since April 2023, there have been 88 verified attacks on healthcare facilities, resulting in 55 deaths and 104 injuries. The destruction of power, water, and sanitation infrastructure has heightened the risk of disease and famine[21][22].

Specific instances of airstrikes on health facilities include the bombing of a major hospital in El Daein, which killed at least 15 people, and an airstrike on a vaccination center west of El Daein Teaching Hospital. The El Daein Teaching Hospital itself was hit, resulting in the deaths of 18 civilians, including six hospital employees, and injuries to approximately 20 others. Patients and medics were forced to evacuate after the bombing[23][25]. In Al-Koma, the lack of necessary medical equipment contributed to the deaths of a woman and her four children following airstrikes[25].

Humanitarian organizations face significant challenges in delivering aid to famine-stricken areas in Sudan. These challenges include delays in humanitarian access, perilous routes crossing battle frontlines, and obstruction by warring parties who impede aid convoys and confiscate supplies. Severe autumn rains have further disrupted major roads and destroyed bridges, complicating the delivery of crucial humanitarian assistance[13][14][17]. The reopening of the Adre border crossing, after a six-month closure, has been pivotal in addressing these challenges. Announced on August 15, this reopening allowed the first inter-agency cross-border transport of vital humanitarian aid since February. The World Food Programme (WFP) successfully transported food supplies for 13,000 people in Kereneik, West Darfur, and the UNHCR sent four trucks of Core Relief Items as part of the first inter-agency convoy on August 21[11][12][14][15][18][19].

The reopening of the Adre crossing is critical for preventing the spread of famine across Sudan. The UN Secretary-General commended the Sudanese authorities for this move, recognizing it as a direct route for humanitarian aid. WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain emphasized the importance of keeping all border crossings open daily to avoid widespread starvation. The Adre border crossing is set to remain open for a three-month period[11][12][13][15][18][19].

In El Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur State, the ongoing RSF siege has led to dire living conditions, with famine looming in the city. Famine conditions have been confirmed in the Zamzam displacement camp near Al Fasher, where people are reportedly starving to death. The city has been under RSF siege since last May, and the five-month blockade has exacerbated the critical living conditions[31][32]. Access to safe water is a significant challenge in Zamzam camp, where all wells are out of service due to a lack of fuel, as the area is surrounded by the RSF. Only two of the eight water wells are currently operational, and efforts to bring water to the camp are hindered by clashes, artillery shelling, and lack of funding[36].
