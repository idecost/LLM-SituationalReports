# Israel-Hamas war-Week 19 2024 

## Summary 
Israeli military operations are escalating in Rafah, Gaza, with Israeli forces seizing the Rafah border crossing on Tuesday, which was a main entry point for aid, thereby dashing ceasefire hopes[27]. This seizure, along with the closure of the Kerem Shalom crossing, has halted the entry of fuel and aid into Gaza, creating a disastrous situation for humanitarian response and depleting critical supplies[30]. Israel has issued evacuation orders for parts of Rafah, causing chaos and panic among the population, with over 150,000 people having fled in recent days and around 300,000 affected by the orders[19]. Vulnerable individuals, including malnourished infants and injured patients, are among those forced to move to already overcrowded and unsafe areas like Al-Mawasi and Khan Younis, which lack adequate shelter and humanitarian supplies[19]. UN officials and humanitarian partners warn that these operations will lead to more death, displacement, and a humanitarian catastrophe, emphasizing that there are no safe spaces in Gaza[17]. Meanwhile, ceasefire talks are stalled, as Hamas accepted a proposal that Israel deemed unacceptable, particularly regarding a permanent end to hostilities[7], and violations against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have also substantially increased[12].

## Cluster Summaries

### Humanitarian and Medical Aid Absence for Displaced in Northern Gaza Strip

The displaced people in the northern Gaza Strip are currently not receiving any medical services or humanitarian aid[1].

### Escalating Conflict in Rafah: IDF Airstrikes and Mass Palestinian Evacuations

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have launched airstrikes on several sites in Rafah in response to rocket and mortar fire directed at Israel, including attacks aimed at the Kerem Shalom Crossing. These military actions also involved IDF troops engaging in close-quarters combat on the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing[1]. The escalation of Israeli operations, coupled with evacuation orders, has severely disrupted humanitarian activities in Gaza[2]. As a consequence, a significant number of Palestinians have been forced to evacuate Rafah, with approximately 50,000 people leaving the southern Gazan city within 48 hours[2][3][4], and over 150,000 fleeing in recent days[2][3][4]. Currently, around 300,000 people are affected by these evacuation orders as the conflict in Rafah intensifies[2][3][4].

The displaced Palestinians are facing dire conditions, expressing fears and sheltering in environments lacking adequate access to food, water, and other essentials[4][5]. The disruption to humanitarian operations, along with the closure of the Rafah Crossing, exacerbates the pre-existing needs in Rafah and throughout Gaza[2]. Among those ordered to move are extremely vulnerable individuals, including malnourished infants, the elderly, injured and sick patients, and people with severe disabilities[4]. Despite the designation of Al-Mawasi as an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone[13], and some displaced individuals perceiving Al-Mawasi and Khan Younis as safe havens[11], the overall situation remains grim, with significant disruptions to humanitarian efforts and many people enduring horrific conditions without sufficient resources[12][13].

### Israel's Control of Rafah Crossing Escalates Threat to Gaza Residents

Israel's control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing is regarded as a "dangerous escalation" that poses a threat to the lives of over a million Palestinians. This crossing serves as the primary lifeline for the Gaza Strip, making its control crucial for the region's inhabitants[1].

### Infrastructure Deficiencies and Humanitarian Concerns Amid Rafah Evacuation Orders

The designated humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi is described as lacking essential infrastructure, being "essentially a sandy area" without "sewage infrastructure," "water infrastructure," or "roads that lead into it" [1]. This lack of infrastructure poses significant challenges, although the sources do not explicitly detail how these might affect the provision of aid [1].

In a related context, UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk has expressed grave concerns over Israel's orders for Palestinians to evacuate parts of Rafah in anticipation of a new offensive. He warned that such actions would exacerbate civilian deaths, suffering, and destruction, which are already at unbearable levels [11]. Gazans, already suffering from bombs, disease, and famine, are now being forced to relocate again as Israeli military operations in Rafah intensify [11]. Türk argues that these evacuation orders violate the fundamental principles of international humanitarian and human rights laws, which are designed to ensure the effective protection of civilians [11].

Furthermore, Türk highlighted the ongoing risks for Palestinians who remain in Rafah, who face potential death and injury from indiscriminate bombing, unlawful killing, or the loss of access to essential resources like food, water, and healthcare [13]. He stressed that such a situation "must not be allowed to happen" and called for accountability for those who choose to ignore international humanitarian and human rights laws [13].

### Gaza Humanitarian Crisis Worsens: Aid Blocked, Fuel and Supplies Depleted

The humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire, with ongoing military operations severely impacting aid delivery and daily life. According to Scott Anderson from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), no aid is being received, and the crossing area remains an active war zone[1]. The Rafah crossing, the main entry point for aid into Gaza, was seized by Israeli forces, further complicating the situation[21][34]. Since last Sunday, no aid has entered Gaza by land, and the closure has severed access to fuel, affecting the entry of critical relief items and restricting the movement of aid workers[36][38].

Fuel is critically needed for humanitarian operations, with current stocks nearly depleted. Andrea de Domenico from the UN humanitarian affairs office (OCHA) reported that humanitarians have only about 30,000 litres of diesel available, while they typically require 200,000 litres daily[13][14][16][19]. The lack of fuel is disastrous for the humanitarian response, as noted by Scott Anderson, and could run out "tomorrow," impacting essential services like health, water, and communication[5][11][15]. Aid agencies are nearly out of food and fuel, with stocks of critical supplies being depleted hourly[20][33][47].

The situation is exacerbated by Israeli military actions, including attacks on Rafah and evacuation orders, which have forced tens of thousands to flee[21][22][23][26][28]. These displaced individuals have nowhere safe to go, as designated evacuation sites like Al-Mawasi are overstretched, lack vital services, and are unsafe[29][47]. The ongoing hostilities have made the situation extremely fluid, with no safe zones in Gaza[31][42].

UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini emphasized the need to "reconstitute our stock to be able to resume distribution in the south of the Gaza Strip"[6]. However, the closure of the Rafah crossing has cut off access to fuel and critical relief items, curtailing the movement of aid workers[11][25][36]. The lack of fuel has also caused bakeries to stop working, leading to a shortage of bread, and has affected the water supply[45].

Despite a ceasefire proposal accepted by Hamas and mediated by Egypt and Qatar, Israel's response was cautious, stating the proposal was far from meeting "necessary requirements"[21]. The Israeli military's actions, including the seizure of the Rafah crossing, have dashed hopes for a ceasefire and further complicated the humanitarian situation[22][29].

Humanitarian teams in Rafah, where over 1 million people, including 600,000 children, remain, face significant challenges[41][42][43][46]. The safety of humanitarian workers is a concern, and more than a quarter of humanitarian missions to northern Gaza in April were impeded by Israeli authorities, with 10 percent denied[34][40][49]. The ongoing military operations and hostilities continue to threaten the delivery of new aid supplies, leaving the people of Gaza in a precarious situation[32][38].

### Fuel Shortage and Blocked Aid Worsen Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza Conflict

The ongoing conflict in Gaza has severely impacted humanitarian operations, particularly in Rafah, where a dire shortage of fuel is crippling essential services. This shortage affects everything from the movement and distribution of food to the operation of hospitals, emergency services, sewage treatment, and telecommunications, with fuel critical for these operations potentially running out soon[5][6]. The situation is exacerbated by the halt in aid flow through the Rafah crossing, with no aid trucks entering since May 5[7]. The Rafah and Karem Abu Salem crossings, which were vital entry points for limited aid, have been disrupted[8]. Israeli forces have seized the Rafah crossing, blocking the passage for people and humanitarian aid, resulting in no fuel or aid entering the Gaza Strip, which is disastrous for the humanitarian response[7]. This closure has also severed access to fuel, affecting the entry of critical relief items and curtailing the movement of aid workers[6].

The humanitarian crisis is further compounded by the lack of safe places in Gaza, as Israel has repeatedly attacked so-called 'safe zones'[7]. Other towns, such as Khan Younis, have been reduced to rubble and remain under attack, making them unsafe[5]. Evacuation orders have uprooted tens of thousands of people in Rafah, sowing fear and confusion among civilians[8]. The meagre humanitarian aid reaching people will be severely disrupted, and the closure of crossings will lead to increased hunger and scarcity[4][6].

Efforts to achieve a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas face significant obstacles. Israel has rejected proposals that do not meet its "core demands"[11] and maintains a "red line" against a permanent end to hostilities[14]. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that he will not accept an end to the war, asserting that Israel has "no choice" but to destroy Hamas, which is his goal[13][14]. Conversely, Hamas finds it unacceptable to release hostages without an assurance of a permanent ceasefire[14]. Hamas has indicated that Israel's rejection of the mediators' proposal has returned negotiations to "the first square"[11], with a senior Hamas official noting that "occupation Israelis turned against the mediators' proposal"[18]. Hamas had agreed to a framework proposal that diverged from the one Israel had helped craft[12].

The situation is further strained by Israel's renewed military activity in Rafah, its plan for an all-out assault on the area, and the seizure of the Rafah crossing by Israeli forces, which have dashed hopes for a ceasefire[11][19]. The UN Secretary-General has called on both Hamas and Israel "to show political courage" to secure a ceasefire[15].
