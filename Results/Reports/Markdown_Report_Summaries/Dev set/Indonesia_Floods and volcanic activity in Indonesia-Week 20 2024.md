# Floods and volcanic activity in Indonesia-Week 20 2024 

## Summary 
Indonesia is currently experiencing multiple natural disasters, primarily severe flash floods and cold lava flows from Mount Marapi in West Sumatra, which began on May 11[12]. The death toll from these events has risen to 67, with 20 people still missing, and earlier reports indicated 57 victims found dead and 22 missing[23]. These disasters have affected at least six regencies and cities, including Agam and Tanah Datar, destroying hundreds of homes and damaging public infrastructure[7]. President Joko Widodo has directed authorities to accelerate the rebuilding of damaged infrastructure, while rescue operations involve thermal drones, excavators, and manual searching for survivors[21]. Weather modification technology is being deployed to reduce rainfall intensity, and a state of emergency is in effect until May 26[11]. Concurrently, Mount Ibu in North Maluku Province has seen a series of eruptions since April, with a significant eruption on May 27 spewing ash 6km high, prompting the evacuation of residents from seven nearby villages and over 12,000 people from a nearby island[20][21][22]. The volcano's alert level has been elevated to IV, and aviation warnings have been issued[21]. Additionally, earlier in May, flooding in Ogan Komering Ulu, South Sumatra, affected 1,695 families and displaced 257, causing substantial material losses[24].

### Mount Ibu Eruption Prompts Evacuations and Aviation Warnings at Alert Level IV

The ongoing volcanic activity of Mount Ibu has prompted significant safety measures and communication efforts to ensure preparedness. The Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (PVMBG) has elevated the alert status of Ibu Volcano to Alert Level IV, following recent volcanic activity [11][21][33]. This heightened alert level has led to the implementation of an emergency alert status, "Siaga Darurat," by BPBD Halmahera Barat, which is actively on-site [1][21].

In response to the eruption, authorities have communicated the need for evacuation, resulting in the relocation of people from seven nearby villages, although the exact number of evacuees from these villages is not specified [22][25][26][51][52][54]. Additionally, more than 12,000 people have been evacuated from a nearby island [22][25][26][51][52][54]. The country's volcanology agency has also issued a warning to aviation authorities managing local flights to ensure safety in the airspace affected by the volcanic activity [25][41].

To further inform the public and relevant stakeholders, the PVMBG has disseminated handout photos depicting Mount Ibu spewing thick smoke, highlighting the severity of the situation [23][24]. These comprehensive measures underscore the coordinated efforts to manage the volcanic threat and safeguard the affected populations.

### Evacuation of 12,000 Due to Island Eruption Lacks Logistical Clarity

Authorities evacuated more than 12,000 people on a nearby island due to an eruption, as reported by multiple sources[1][2][12][13][21][22]. However, these sources do not provide specific details about the measures implemented to manage the evacuation or the logistical support provided to assist the evacuees[1][2][12][13]. Although one source mentions a muddy road, it does not connect this detail to the actions of the authorities or the evacuation process itself[21].

### Evacuation and Temporary Shelter Response Following Ibu Volcano Eruption

Residents evacuated due to the eruption of Ibu volcano were transported in pickup trucks and accommodated in emergency tents for the night[1][31]. The provided sources do not contain further information regarding the current status of these or other temporary accommodations.

### Indonesian Government Enhances Disaster Preparedness and Infrastructure Recovery Efforts

The Indonesian government, through the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) and the Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation Center (PVMBG), is taking proactive measures to enhance disaster preparedness and response. One such initiative involves training a team of residents in each village surrounding the volcano to assist with potential evacuations[1]. In parallel, the government is addressing the rebuilding of infrastructure in West Sumatra, with President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo urging authorities to expedite the reconstruction of damaged public infrastructure[12]. While most roads and temporary bridges have been rebuilt, some remain under construction[11]. Efforts to clear debris and repair infrastructure are ongoing, with heavy equipment being utilized to clean up disaster areas[11][13]. For example, on May 17, 2024, an excavator was employed to construct a temporary bridge over a river in Nagari Sungai Bambu, Tanah Datar regency, facilitating the delivery of aid to flood victims[12].

In addition to these efforts, the BNPB is employing weather modification technology, commonly known as cloud seeding, to manage rainfall intensity in disaster-struck areas[31]. This technology is used to aid rescue efforts by making clouds release rain earlier, thereby reducing the rainfall's intensity when it reaches the affected areas[31]. Specifically, the BNPB has been attempting to redirect rain away from rivers on the slopes of the volcano, in response to forecasts of moderate to heavy precipitation by the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG)[21][26][32]. This strategic use of cloud seeding aims to mitigate the impact of heavy rainfall on vulnerable regions[24].

### Mount Marapi Lava Flow Crisis: Expanded Danger Zone and Rising Casualties

The danger zone around Mount Marapi has been extended westward by 3 kilometers from the summit due to the movement of lava flow toward Amakaka from the western area. This lava flow has reached a distance of 1,200 meters from the summit, impacting the village of Amakaka, which is 2,800 meters away from the flow's current position[1]. In Ogan Komering Ulu, the situation is dire, with 1,695 families affected and 257 families displaced. The material losses are significant, including 1,695 housing units, 4 worship facilities, a broken suspension bridge, and 10 hectares of agricultural land[11][12].

In response to the crisis, the West Sumatra Police's elite Mobile Brigade Brimob has established a field kitchen in Sungai Pua village, Agam district, to provide cooked meals to villagers severely affected by the cold lava flood from Mount Marapi[21]. The death toll from the flash floods and cold lava flow in West Sumatra has tragically risen to 67 as of Thursday. The numbers have steadily increased from 43 deaths reported on May 11, to 44 by May 13, 50 by May 14, 52 by Tuesday, 57 by May 14, 58 by Wednesday, and 62 by Wednesday[32][34][36][37][40].

Approximately 3,200 people have been temporarily displaced to safer areas, with more than 3,000 evacuated[31][40]. As of Thursday, 20 people remain missing, down from an earlier count of 25, with five of those previously missing now confirmed dead[34]. Search and rescue operations continue for the missing individuals, involving local rescuers, police, and military personnel[36][37][38].

### ASEAN Disaster Management Enhanced Amidst Severe Agricultural Challenges Due to Weather

The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) and the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre) are working together to enhance disaster risk reduction and humanitarian assistance across the ASEAN region. This collaboration has led to the launch and continuous enhancement of the Disaster Monitoring and Response System (DMRS), which provides near-real-time impact analysis, advanced analytics, insights, and actionable information for a multitude of hazards, serving all ASEAN Member States[1][11][31]. The DMRS, powered by PDC's DisasterAWARE technology, was launched in 2012 as a joint effort between PDC and the AHA Centre[31][32]. Located in Jakarta, Indonesia, the AHA Centre is tasked with coordinating disaster management among ASEAN Member States and offers early warning and impact analysis through DMRS, along with training and capacity development[2][12][31][32].

In addition to these technological advancements, PDC and the AHA Centre have collaborated on disaster risk assessments and exercise engagements, including ARDEX, ADMM-Plus, and national-level exercises, to further strengthen the region's disaster preparedness[2][12]. The DMRS empowers decision-makers by providing them with the necessary tools to understand risks and quickly mobilize life-saving humanitarian resources[31].

Meanwhile, the agricultural sector faces challenges due to extreme weather conditions. Torrential rain and prolonged drought have severely impacted pepper farming, leading to dying plants, no harvest, and lower quality produce[21]. Earlier in the season, torrential rain destroyed the plants' flowers, and the subsequent drought caused more plants to die due to the lack of water[21]. Farmers reported extreme heat and no rain, resulting in no water for the pepper plants, with one farmer expecting no harvest this year compared to nine tonnes last year[21][22]. Another farmer noted that the little that could be harvested was of lower quality, predicting a scarcity of pepper for 2024 and 2025[23]. However, the sources do not specify that these agricultural impacts occurred in Indonesia.
