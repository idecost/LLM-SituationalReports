# Monsoon floods and rains in Pakistan-Week 31 2024 

## Summary 
Pakistan is currently grappling with widespread monsoon rains and flash floods, which between July 1 and August 1, led to 108 deaths, 216 injuries, and damage to over 550 houses, predominantly affecting Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Punjab provinces[10]. Urban flooding has been reported in various areas, with Lahore experiencing record rainfall that caused significant disruption, including electricity suspension, road closures, and submerged hospitals[13]. The floods have also damaged critical infrastructure such as bridges and roads, disrupting traffic in KP and Kashmir[10]. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued an "ALERT" for more torrential monsoon rains from August 1-6, warning of potential further flash flooding and landslides nationwide[14][17][18]. Simultaneously, the country is experiencing social unrest, including protests near the capital over escalating power bills and demonstrations in Balochistan concerning human rights, where hundreds have been detained and an internet shutdown imposed[25]. Additionally, a violent land dispute in Parachinar, Kurram, has resulted in significant casualties and a temporary ceasefire[15].

## Cluster Summaries

### Enhancing Disability Inclusion in Cash for Work Programs: Key Recommendations

The provided sources offer recommendations aimed at enhancing the participation of people with disabilities in Cash for Work programs. These suggestions include providing specialized transportation or an additional amount, not exceeding three dollars per working day, to cover transportation costs[2]. Furthermore, employers are encouraged to implement concrete measures to increase the involvement of persons with disabilities[6]. It is important to note, however, that these recommendations are not specifically associated with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the documents provided.

### Monsoon Rains Fail to Deter Protests Over Pakistan's Rising Energy Costs

Despite the pouring monsoon rains, approximately 3,000 supporters of a major Islamist party continued a sit-in protest on a main road into Pakistan's capital, demonstrating against skyrocketing power bills[1][41]. These protests persisted even as the monsoon season brought heavy rains, highlighting the public's frustration with energy costs that have more than doubled for some due to added taxes[41]. A private school teacher in Lahore expressed that half of her salary now goes to the energy bill, making it difficult to manage household expenses[41].

In Pakistan's southwest, thousands protested against police violence, an internet shutdown, and highway closures, although these grievances were not directly linked to the monsoon floods or rains[11][35]. The sources do not explicitly connect these protests to the security situation in Balochistan or the activities of insurgent groups[35].

In Gwadar, nearly 100,000 residents depend on natural sources such as rain and traditional dams for water[25][51]. However, the sources do not specify how monsoon floods or rains have exacerbated challenges related to basic necessities for Gwadar residents[51]. While the monsoon rains are mentioned in the context of protests over power bills, there is no direct link to the tensions between the Baloch population and the federal government[27].

### Pakistan Faces Dual Crisis: Malnutrition and Severe Monsoon Flooding Challenges

Pakistan is grappling with a complex malnutrition crisis, characterized by high levels of undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and a rising prevalence of overweight and obesity, along with diet-related non-communicable diseases. This situation underscores the urgent need to review and update the National Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) guidelines to align with the latest national and global recommendations, ensuring the quality and effectiveness of CMAM protocols, strategies, and implementation[1].

Concurrently, Pakistan is facing severe challenges due to monsoon rains, particularly in urban areas like Lahore. The city experienced a record rainfall of 337 millimeters, leading to overwhelmed drainage systems, urban flooding, electricity suspension, road closures, and submerged hospitals and low-lying areas[14][16][18]. In response, efforts are underway to pump rainwater off main roads, with Wasa's drainage operations continuing without interruption[15][16]. City and District Administrations have been instructed to implement contingency plans for flood-vulnerable urban centers, including prompt de-watering operations in flooded areas[20]. Rescuers across the province are actively working to assist those affected[12]. Additionally, the NHA, FWO, and Local CW Departments are tasked with ensuring the pre-placement of machinery and timely restoration of damaged road linkages[12].

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued an advisory to relevant authorities, urging them to remain "ALERT" and take necessary measures to prevent any untoward situations[27][30]. The PMD predicts that torrential monsoon rains may generate flash flooding in local nullahs/streams and landslides, potentially causing road closures in vulnerable hilly areas[21][27]. Heavy rainfall is expected to exacerbate flooding conditions[26].

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is actively responding to the monsoon rains by reporting on rain-related incidents, including casualties and damages[35]. The NDMA has warned that various parts of the country are likely to experience urban and flash flooding, with current and future rain spells projected[32]. It has issued advisories indicating that monsoon currents are expected to affect central and southern parts of the country, with heavy rainfall anticipated[33]. To mitigate the impact of potential urban flooding, efforts are underway to pump rainwater off main roads[38]. The NDMA advises populations at risk to avoid floodwaters and seek safe locations, and it recommends avoiding crossing bridges if water is flowing rapidly due to their hazardous nature during floods[31][35].

The National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) is addressing the risk of urban flooding by forecasting rainfall and thundershowers in southern and northeastern Punjab and northeastern Sindh, which may trigger urban flooding in these regions[41]. Populations at risk are advised to avoid floodwaters and find safe locations away from flood-prone areas, ensuring roofs and windows are properly sealed to prevent water leakage[41].

The sixth spell of monsoon rains in Punjab, predicted from August 1 to 6, is expected to bring strong winds and thundershowers[51]. Heavy rainfall during this period may cause further flooding[57]. Torrential monsoon rains are anticipated, which may generate flash flooding in local nullahs/streams and cause landslides leading to road closures in vulnerable hilly areas[56]. Intense rain-windstorms and thundershowers with heavy to very heavy rainfall are also expected in Punjab from August 1 to 7, 2024[59]. Most districts of south Punjab are likely to face strong winds and thundershowers, with monsoon rains expected in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur, Lahore, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, and Gujarat divisions[51].

### Pakistani Authorities Urged to Protect Protesters' Rights and Address Sectarian Violence

The provided sources highlight the urgent need for Pakistani authorities to uphold the right to peaceful protest and assembly, emphasizing the importance of using only the minimum force necessary and ensuring the protection of protesters' rights[1]. Human Rights Watch has reinforced this stance, urging authorities to exercise restraint in their response to demonstrations, release individuals detained for peaceful protest, and restore internet access to facilitate communication[3][4]. These calls align with the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, which dictate that security forces must avoid excessive force, using firearms only when less harmful means are impracticable and to the minimum extent necessary, with lethal force reserved solely for situations where it is strictly unavoidable to protect life[7].

Despite these guidelines, there is a notable absence of specific measures addressing the safety and protection of protesters during the monsoon season. Although general updates on the monsoon are mentioned, they do not directly relate to ensuring the safety of protesters in such conditions[7].

In a related context, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has expressed deep concern over the significant loss of life in Parachinar, Kurram, where a violent land dispute between rival tribes has exacerbated sectarian conflict[11][12]. This violence has severely affected ordinary citizens, restricting their freedom of movement and access to essential resources such as food and medical supplies[11]. The HRCP has called on the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government to ensure the maintenance of a brokered ceasefire[11] and has urged the government to facilitate peace negotiations in the area[12]. The commission stressed that all disputes, whether related to land or sectarian issues, should be resolved peacefully through negotiations convened by the KP government, with representation from all stakeholders[11].
