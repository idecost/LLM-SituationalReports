    "summary": "Haiti is currently facing a worsening humanitarian crisis driven by alarming rates of armed gang violence, which has severely disrupted daily life, forced mass displacement, and exacerbated acute food insecurity[63][139][142]. Armed gangs control nearly 80% of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince and are expanding into rural regions, terrorizing residents with killings, rapes, and kidnappings, while also impeding the movement of people and goods[3]. A recent attack on October 3, 2024, in the Pont Sond area of the Artibonite department, resulted in at least 70 deaths and 357 injuries, displacing an estimated 6,270 people[135][136][138]. Over 700,000 people are internally displaced across the country, a 22% increase since June, with many lacking essential food, water, shelter, and medical care[75]. Nearly half of Haiti's population, over 5 million people, is experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or worse) between August 2024 and February 2025, including 6,000 people facing catastrophic hunger (IPC Phase 5) and 2 million at emergency levels (IPC Phase 4)[124][139][142]. In response to the escalating violence, Prime Minister Garry Conille announced a joint operation with Kenyan police on August 29, 2024, to target criminal gangs in Port-au-Prince[129], and a UN-backed Kenyan mission, which began in late June, is working to quell violence but requires substantial additional personnel and resources[63]. The crisis also poses severe protection risks for children, with an average of five killed per week in the first half of 2024, and leaves women and girls highly vulnerable to gender-based violence[41].",

            "cluster_summary": "The severe food insecurity in Haiti is a multifaceted crisis driven by displacement, lack of stable employment, scarcity of food, and competition for aid. Families are often forced to flee their homes due to gang violence, which restricts their access to markets and essential resources[15][16][12]. The drying up of construction jobs has left individuals like Yonel, a former mason, searching for alternative means of income, such as making charcoal[21][22][24][25][26]. His wife contributes by selling second-hand clothes, yet they struggle to provide daily meals for their seven children, often resorting to eating only white rice or spaghetti[23][30]. On some days, Yonel and his wife take only a spoonful of food to leave more for their children, highlighting the dire food scarcity where food meant for one must feed ten[22][25][26][27].\n\nThe displacement crisis is exacerbated by the lack of access to markets, as seen in the case of Alexandra, who fled to the outskirts of Port-au-Prince and reported insufficient food due to market inaccessibility[31]. The scarcity of food is compounded by the high costs and inflation, with food prices having risen by 40% since early 2024, driven by supply chain disruptions and low agricultural production[361][364]. This inflation has led to food expenditure accounting for up to 70% of household expenses, severely limiting access to food for displaced individuals[352][358].\n\nThe displacement following attacks in the commune of Saint Marc on October 3, 2024, resulted in 6,270 individuals being displaced, with 88% seeking refuge with relatives or host families[71][72][75][77]. However, the strain on host communities is immense, with significant difficulties reported, including food shortages and overwhelmed healthcare facilities[101][109]. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is working with partners to ensure humanitarian assistance reaches those displaced, despite challenges in accessing areas controlled by armed groups[111][348].\n\nThe humanitarian response in Haiti faces numerous challenges, including restricted access due to armed groups, funding shortfalls, and a severe security crisis following the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021[175][178][181][182]. The UN-backed Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, led by Kenya, aims to quell gang violence and enhance national security, but it requires increased international financial and logistical assistance to be effective[311][316][317]. The mission has achieved some initial successes, such as securing key infrastructure, but much work remains to restore stability and security[323][324][326].\n\nThe humanitarian needs in Haiti are vast, with over 700,000 people displaced due to gang violence[311]. Displaced women and girls are particularly vulnerable, facing increased risks of gender-based violence (GBV) and relying on harmful coping mechanisms due to food insecurity and high market prices[221][222][241][246]. Only 15 out of 85 IDP sites in Haiti receive protection services, highlighting the urgent need for increased service provision and security improvements[231][232][245][246].\n\nHumanitarian organizations are calling for increased funding and support to address these challenges, with a $674 million humanitarian appeal for Haiti receiving just over a third of its funding[234][240]. The World Food Programme (WFP) and other agencies are urgently calling for broad-based support to increase lifesaving assistance, particularly food and healthcare supplies[373][378]. The coalition of humanitarian and development agencies is advocating for safe and unfettered humanitarian access and sustainable pathways to peace[381][382][383].\n\nThe ongoing gang violence and control of major roads have significantly impacted the delivery of aid and food supplies, with road closures and high bribes exacerbating food insecurity[301][305][308]. The situation is dire, with 6,000 people classified under IPC Phase 5 Catastrophe, facing catastrophic levels of hunger and a collapse of livelihoods[411][412][414]. The transitional government, along with the MSS and humanitarian groups, requires significant resources to restore state control and ensure access to basic necessities[291].\n\nIn response to these challenges, Save the Children is providing cash assistance to displaced families and host families, while calling for full, unfettered access for aid workers and increased humanitarian funding[443]. The Security Council is urged to support the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance and mobilize additional funds to support the response[450]. The collective efforts of international partners, humanitarian organizations, and the Haitian government are crucial to addressing the severe humanitarian crisis and restoring hope and stability in Haiti[201][203][204].",

            "cluster_summary": "The severe food insecurity in Haiti is driven by a complex interplay of factors, including displacement, restricted access to markets, lack of stable employment, and insufficient income. Families are often forced to flee their homes due to gang violence, which not only displaces them but also cuts off their access to essential markets, exacerbating their inability to secure food [15][16][12]. The scarcity of food is further compounded by the drying up of construction jobs, pushing individuals like Jean Yonel to resort to alternative means such as making charcoal [15][17][35]. Remittances, which some families rely on, are insufficient, lasting barely a week and failing to meet daily food needs [18][15][40].\n\nThe availability of food is infrequent, with many individuals struggling to obtain even one meal a day [12][15][34]. When food is available, it is often insufficient, with portions meant for one person being stretched to feed ten [15][35]. This dire situation forces families to adopt extreme coping mechanisms, such as parents eating minimal amounts to leave more for their children [32][35]. In displacement camps, young girls face coercion into trading sex for food, highlighting the vulnerability and desperation of the situation [16][36].\n\nThe humanitarian response is hindered by gang-imposed roadblocks, which disrupt aid delivery and inflate food prices due to high bribes and blocked supply routes [71][141][145][148]. This has led to a significant increase in the cost of the food basket, with prices rising by up to 16% in certain regions [151][171]. Consequently, food expenditure now accounts for up to 70% of household budgets, further limiting access to food [172][181].\n\nEfforts to address these challenges include mobile response teams and flexible assistance modalities, such as Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA), to optimize humanitarian aid [72][74]. Organizations are also expanding support to community kitchens and income generation sources to aid those on the move [72]. However, the scale of protection services for women and girls remains inadequate, with only 15 out of 85 IDP sites receiving necessary services [81][87].\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) has reached thousands with food and cash-based transfers, yet the impact on overall food security remains unclear [91]. Malnutrition is a critical issue, with nearly 125,000 children facing severe acute malnutrition as of July 2024, exacerbated by violence, poverty, and political instability [231][238]. Save the Children and other organizations are calling for increased humanitarian funding and unfettered access for aid delivery to combat these challenges [233][240].\n\nThe transitional government and humanitarian groups lack sufficient resources to effectively address the crisis, necessitating more international support and coordination [121][111]. The collective of humanitarian agencies is urging the international community to increase funding and ensure safe humanitarian access to alleviate the escalating hunger crisis [191][192][193]. The Security Council is also called upon to facilitate the safe delivery of aid and mobilize additional funds to support the humanitarian response [240].",

            "cluster_summary": "Haiti is grappling with a severe humanitarian crisis exacerbated by gang violence, displacement, and food insecurity. Over 700,000 people have been displaced due to escalating violence, with approximately 702,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the country, including 37% in the Metropolitan Area of Port-au-Prince (MAPAP) [221][145]. The displacement crisis is compounded by the dire living conditions in IDP sites, where women and girls face heightened risks of gender-based violence (GBV) due to inadequate protection services and poor infrastructure, such as latrines and showers lacking gender separation and nighttime lighting [141][146][147].\n\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) and other humanitarian organizations are working to address these challenges, but access to essential services remains limited. Only 15 out of 85 IDP sites receive protection services, and humanitarian access is often blocked by insecurity and violence [131][132][133]. The UNHCR is calling for increased attention and support to mitigate protection risks and improve access to basic services for displaced populations [81][83][84].\n\nIn response to the crisis, the UN-backed Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, led by Kenya, aims to enhance national security and establish conditions for free and fair elections. This mission has achieved initial successes, such as securing key infrastructure, but requires substantial resources and international support to reach its full potential [221][227][228]. The mission's efforts are crucial for creating conditions that allow Haitian authorities to secure the country and undertake social and economic reconstruction [228].\n\nFood insecurity is a pressing issue, with over one million people in Haiti expected to require treatment for malnutrition in 2024 [236]. The World Food Programme (WFP) is urgently calling for increased support to provide lifesaving assistance to families facing extreme food shortages and spiraling malnutrition [237]. Humanitarian food agencies and NGOs are short of US$230 million needed to implement programs until the end of the year [237]. The scarcity and high costs of market products further amplify the vulnerability of women and girls to violence and exploitation [132][136].\n\nHealthcare access is severely constrained, particularly in Port-au-Prince, where 40% of inpatient facilities have closed due to insecurity [231][234]. Project HOPE is addressing healthcare needs by supporting health facilities in the Sud and Grand'Anse departments, providing primary health care services, and conducting awareness-raising activities on GBV and mental health [161][162]. However, the demand for increased medical care is anticipated due to potential rises in waterborne diseases and increased internal displacement [121][122].\n\nThe Haitian Government, in collaboration with the World Bank, is focusing on restructuring operations to deliver targeted and timely results, with a strong emphasis on rural areas to promote access to sustainable basic services [151]. However, the increasing control of armed gangs and the resulting insecurity remain significant barriers to effective humanitarian response and development efforts [251].\n\nTo address these multifaceted challenges, increased international support and coordination are essential. The transitional government requires significant resources to restore state control, ensure access to basic necessities, and implement programs to support survivors of sexual violence and vulnerable children [191][201]. The Security Council is urged to call for the safe and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance and to mobilize additional flexible funds to support the humanitarian response [280].\n\nIn summary, Haiti's humanitarian crisis demands a comprehensive and coordinated response to address the urgent needs of displaced populations, improve security, and provide essential services. The international community's support is crucial in alleviating the suffering of Haitians and fostering long-term stability and development in the country.",

            "cluster_summary": "The current living conditions in displacement sites significantly increase the risk of gender-based violence (GBV) for women and girls, primarily due to inadequate living conditions and a lack of basic necessities such as food, water, and resources[1][2][4]. Food insecurity, coupled with the scarcity and high costs of market products, exacerbates their vulnerability to violence, sexual exploitation, and abuse, forcing them to rely on harmful coping mechanisms[3][5][11][12]. Specific risks identified in these sites include the lack of gender-separated latrines and showers, many of which lack locks, and the absence of nighttime lighting, all of which contribute to the unsafe environment[8][23][24][28]. Additionally, women and girls face attacks from armed groups as they travel to work or school, further highlighting the insecurity and violence prevalent in these areas[4][23].\n\nTo address these challenges, there is an urgent need for protection services, reproductive health services, shelter, food, water, sanitation, and hygiene for women and girls[3][5][22]. UNFPA and its partners are actively working to provide integrated sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and GBV services through mobile teams deployed to IDP sites[3][6][12][25][26]. These teams also offer remote psychosocial support, referrals, case documentation, and GBV information via a hotline, alongside awareness-raising activities on GBV and SRH[3][6][12][25]. Four temporary women and girls' safe spaces have been established to address gaps in psychosocial support and case management services[6][12][25]. Despite these efforts, only 15 out of 85 IDP sites in Haiti currently receive protection services, indicating a significant shortfall in the scale of current interventions[5][7][11][17][21][22].\n\nThe barriers preventing internally displaced persons (IDPs) from accessing essential protection services include limited service availability, insecurity and violence, poor living conditions, lack of resources and capacity, underreporting of GBV cases, and funding shortfalls[21][22][23][24][27][30]. Insecurity, marked by increased criminal incidents such as armed robberies and kidnappings, particularly in the Metropolitan Area of Port-au-Prince (MAPAP), further restricts humanitarian access and the establishment of safe spaces[23][24][27]. The lack of resources is evident in the scarcity of health services post-sexual violence, with only 3% of rape cases treated within 72 hours due to access constraints and inadequate facilities and staff[27]. Additionally, a $674 million humanitarian appeal for Haiti has received just over a third of its funding, with UNFPA mobilizing only 19% of its required funds[24][30].\n\nTo mitigate these risks and support GBV survivors, there is a need to increase service provision, improve security, deploy mobile and remote services, establish safe spaces, and strengthen coordination and capacity among humanitarian actors[22][24][25][28][29][30]. A round table involving GBV actors, women's associations, government, UN agencies, and NGOs has been held to identify concrete actions to address GBV[16][23]. Project HOPE and UNFPA have conducted mental health and GBV awareness activities, reaching thousands of people[25][29]. The Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission continues to support the Haitian National Police in securing public safety and protecting critical infrastructure[28][29][30].\n\nThe humanitarian crisis in Haiti, marked by gender-based violence, including sexual violence, requires significant resources and international support to implement programs for survivors and vulnerable children in areas controlled by criminal groups[31][33][35]. The transitional government, with Prime Minister Garry Conille at the helm, has vowed to bring perpetrators to justice and ensure victims receive restitution, emphasizing the need for a robust legal response and international coordination to restore security and uphold human rights[31][32][34].",

            "cluster_summary": "Following the attacks in the commune of Saint Marc, Artibonite Department, on October 3, 2024, a total of 6,270 individuals, comprising 1,281 households, were displaced[11][12][15][17][26][28][30]. Of these displaced individuals, 88 percent sought refuge with relatives or other host families in the communes of La Chapelle, Montrouis, Petite Rivière de l'Artibonite, and Saint-Marc, while the remaining 12 percent found refuge in three separate sites[11][15][17][26][28][30]. The municipalities of Verrettes and Saint-Marc host almost half of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Artibonite, with the vast majority being accommodated by host families[18][19]. However, the sources do not provide information on how host communities in Artibonite Department are coping with this influx or what specific support mechanisms are in place to assist them.\n\nThe anticipated above-average rainfall and temperature due to La Niña in eastern Haiti could exacerbate the situation by increasing the risk of waterborne diseases, necessitating enhanced medical care for both displaced and host communities[31][32]. Essential resources needed to address these challenges include health, protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services[33], primary health care, pharmaceuticals, and medicines, as well as the promotion of sanitation and hygiene[38]. Hygiene promotion and awareness-raising activities, covering topics such as hand hygiene, food safety, and waste management, are also crucial[35]. Clean water sources and responses to extreme weather and health crises are necessary, along with training for frontline health workers[38][40].\n\nThese resources can be mobilized effectively through Project HOPE's response in departments such as Sud, Nippes, and Grand'Anse[33], programs that increase access to primary health care and protection services, mobile clinic activities, and hygiene promotion activities[38]. Following the recent attack in Pont-Sond, Haiti, immediate humanitarian needs include care for the injured, support for the medical system, including the area's lone and overwhelmed hospital, and the provision of medical supplies[42][44]. The dire humanitarian situation is further marked by gender-based violence, including sexual violence, mass displacement, and extreme hunger[43][44]. Support is needed for survivors of sexual violence and vulnerable children[41].\n\nTo address these needs effectively, more international support and coordination are required, as aid organizations and other groups currently lack sufficient resources to tackle the challenges[41]. Prioritization should include restoring state control, ensuring residents have access to basic necessities such as food, health care, and education, rebuilding the justice system, and implementing programs to support survivors of sexual violence and vulnerable children[41].\n\nIn the Port-au-Prince Metropolitan Area (ZMPAP), additional resources are necessary to support the increasing number of IDPs, as humanitarian food assistance is not expected to meet the population's needs[51]. The World Food Programme (WFP) is urgently calling for broad-based support to massively increase lifesaving assistance, as humanitarian food agencies and NGOs in Haiti are short of US$230 million to implement programs[53]. Specific needs include increased humanitarian aid, particularly food and healthcare supplies[57][58], support to address food inflation, which limits displaced people's access to food, and improved access to education for displaced children[56]. WASH services are critical, as many lack access to clean water, soap for handwashing, and improved sanitation systems[60]. Humanitarian aid for mental health and psychosocial support, including psychological support for newly displaced children, is also needed, along with more health workers to ensure children can access proper care[59]. Additionally, the distribution of shelter kits, kitchen kits, and non-food item (NFI) kits, as well as financial transfers to displaced households, are essential[51][58].",

            "cluster_summary": "The drying up of construction jobs in Haiti has severely impacted individuals like Yonel, a former mason, who now resorts to searching for wood to make charcoal as an alternative means of income[1][2][4][5][6]. His wife contributes by selling second-hand clothes[4], yet the family struggles to provide for their seven children[10]. This dire situation often results in days where the family subsists on only white rice or spaghetti[3]. In an effort to ensure their children's survival, Yonel and his wife sometimes consume only a spoonful of food, leaving the rest for their children[2][6][7]. The food that would typically feed one person now has to sustain ten, offering just enough nourishment to survive[5]. On particularly difficult days, Yonel's wife mixes flour with spinach to quell their children's hunger[4][6].\n\nThe lack of access to markets further exacerbates food insecurity for displaced individuals like Alexandra, who fled to the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. She reported that they \"couldn't go to the markets\" and consequently \"didn't have enough food to eat\"[11]. This situation is compounded by the ongoing gang violence in Haiti, which severely impacts the country's social fabric and economic stability[44]. Violent criminal groups control nearly 80 percent of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince and are increasingly active in rural areas[26]. These groups disrupt daily life, force people to flee their homes, and cause acute food insecurity to rise[43]. More than 3,600 people have been killed in gang violence this year alone, with an estimated 3,661 deaths since January, averaging over 13 deaths daily[47][48].\n\nTo address these challenges, Haiti is prioritizing the development of resilient infrastructure to improve economic opportunities, especially for the rural population in agricultural value chains, public service delivery, and urban mobility systems[22]. This includes constructing a hundred bridges to connect rural communities to public markets, opportunities, and basic services such as health and education[22]. Important road construction and rehabilitation are underway in Les Cayes, facilitating quick access to humanitarian relief[22][29]. The World Bank Group is engaged in improving early warning systems, providing safe havens, and strengthening the government's emergency response capacity[21]. The new National Emergency Operations Center, partly financed by the International Development Association (IDA), will enhance coordination among at-risk populations before, during, or after climatic, geological, or other events[25]. Ongoing projects also include departmental and communal Emergency Operation Centers and construction sites for safe havens[25].\n\nDespite these efforts, the sources do not explicitly detail how the prioritized infrastructure developments directly address vulnerabilities exacerbated by gang violence. The Haitian Government, in collaboration with the World Bank, is restructuring existing operations to deliver targeted and timely results on the ground[31]. The World Bank has adopted a strong rural focus, with over 80% of its programs implemented in more stable communities outside of Port-au-Prince, aiming to promote access to sustainable basic services[31]. However, the sources do not detail how these efforts specifically target communities affected by gang violence.\n\nThe ongoing gang violence has left over 700,000 people homeless in recent years, with more than half of the displaced being children[43][44]. To mitigate these impacts, a UN-backed Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission led by Kenya began in late June[43]. This mission aims to quell gang violence[44] and maintain its gains to enhance national security and establish conditions for free and fair elections[41]. Around 600 Kenyan police officers were deployed between June and July 2024, with Jamaica deploying soldiers in September to support them[45][48]. The mission has achieved some initial successes, including securing the airport and other key infrastructure[46]. However, officials state much work remains, and there are calls for increased international financial and logistical assistance to the MSS mission[43][44][47][48]. Kenya plans to send 600 more police officers to Haiti from this month to January[49].\n\nInflation remains high in Haiti, with food expenditure accounting for up to 70 percent of total household expenditure[51]. Food prices have risen by 40% since the beginning of 2024, driven by supply chain disruptions caused by insecurity and anticipated low production from the spring harvest[54]. Agricultural production in 2024 has been below the seasonal average due to erratic rainfall and overall insecurity affecting access to land, seed availability, and labor costs[51]. While humanitarian food assistance is expected to be a priority need for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host communities[53], the sources do not detail specific measures being taken to address the high inflation rate or reduce the percentage of total household expenditure on food. Humanitarian food agencies and NGOs are also facing a US$230 million shortfall to implement programs until the end of the year[51]. UN Women has transferred US$120 to each of 150 displaced households[53].\n\nThe key factors contributing to the rise in food prices in Haiti include violence and security crises[62], inflation[62], and gang control of major roads blocking food supplies[61]. These factors have driven prices out of reach for millions[62], forcing heads of families to choose between feeding themselves or their children[61], and leading women and girls to offer sex for food[67].",

This mission comprises around 400 personnel, with participation from officers from Jamaica and Belize, contributing to the efforts to stabilize the region[1][2][3][4]. While there have been reports of improvements in the security situation, the sources do not explicitly detail how the MSS mission's specific efforts directly impact the overall security landscape[6].\n\nHaiti is focusing on developing resilient infrastructure to enhance economic opportunities, particularly for the rural population involved in agricultural value chains, public service delivery, and making urban mobility systems more inclusive[12]. This initiative includes constructing a hundred bridges to connect rural communities to public markets and essential services such as health and education[12]. Significant road construction and rehabilitation efforts are underway in Les Cayes, facilitating quick access to humanitarian relief and connecting rural communities[12][19].\n\nThe World Bank Group is involved in enhancing early warning systems, providing safe havens, and strengthening the government's emergency response capacity[11]. The new National Emergency Operations Center, partially funded by the International Development Association (IDA), aims to improve coordination among at-risk populations before, during, or after climatic, geological, or other events[15]. Ongoing projects include the development of departmental and communal Emergency Operation Centers, construction sites for safe havens, and rural houses built through hands-on training in improved local construction techniques[15]. Additionally, Project HOPE is working to improve sanitation and waste management at Hospital Immaculee Conception in Les Cayes and Hospital Saint Antoine in Jeremie, with targeted WASH repairs and rehabilitation works, including the construction of shower cubicles, installation of a sump pump and water tank, and rehabilitation of latrine blocks[19].\n\nDespite these efforts, gang violence remains a significant challenge in Haiti, with violent criminal groups controlling nearly 80 percent of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince and becoming increasingly active in rural areas[14][16]. These groups hinder the free movement of people and goods and can disrupt national and local supply chains unexpectedly[16][17]. However, the sources do not explicitly detail how the prioritized infrastructure developments directly address vulnerabilities exacerbated by gang violence.\n\nIn the realm of education, online courses are available for children unable to attend school, but access is limited to those who can afford Wi-Fi and a generator[21]. Most Haitians face chronic power outages, spending considerable time without electricity, which restricts access to these online educational resources[21]. The sources do not describe any initiatives to provide access to online courses for children lacking Wi-Fi and electricity.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by attacks from armed gangs on government infrastructure, including prisons, police stations, the airport, and the seaport in the ZMPAP region since March 2024, which have severely limited the work of humanitarian responders and effectively paralyzed the Government[42].",

            "cluster_summary": "The ongoing crisis in Haiti, marked by escalating gang violence and economic instability, has severely impacted the lives of its citizens, leading to widespread displacement and acute food insecurity. Over 700,000 people have been displaced due to gang violence, with more than half being children[131][144]. The violence has not only disrupted daily life but also paralyzed the economy, undermining institutions and leaving thousands homeless[141][143]. In response, a UN-backed Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, led by Kenya, was initiated in late June to quell gang violence and enhance national security[131][137][144]. This mission has seen the deployment of around 600 Kenyan police officers, with plans to send 600 more by January[133][139][149]. Despite initial successes, such as securing key infrastructure, the mission requires further international financial and logistical support to achieve its full deployment of 2,500 personnel[138][146].\n\nThe displacement crisis has been exacerbated by the drying up of construction jobs, forcing individuals like Yonel, a former mason, to resort to making charcoal for income[11][12][14][15][16]. His wife contributes by selling second-hand clothes, yet they struggle to provide for their seven children, often subsisting on minimal meals of white rice or spaghetti[13][14][20]. On some days, they mix flour with spinach to stave off hunger[14][16]. The lack of access to markets further exacerbates food insecurity for displaced individuals like Alexandra, who fled to the outskirts of Port-au-Prince and reported insufficient food due to market inaccessibility[21].\n\nFollowing attacks in the commune of Saint Marc, Artibonite Department, on October 3, 2024, 6,270 individuals were displaced, with 88 percent seeking refuge with relatives or host families in nearby communes[31][32][35][37]. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is working with partners to ensure humanitarian assistance reaches those displaced, particularly in inaccessible areas like Port-au-Prince[41]. However, the lack of detailed support mechanisms for host communities in Artibonite remains a concern.\n\nThe humanitarian response is further challenged by severe protection risks faced by internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Port-au-Prince and Ouanaminthe, including shortages of food, water, shelter, and medical care[71][72]. UNHCR is actively working to mitigate these risks by calling for increased support and solutions for those affected by violence and insecurity[71][73]. Efforts include improving access to birth registration to prevent statelessness and engaging with governments to ensure protection for Haitians[74].\n\nHumanitarian organizations are urged to enhance their response by addressing health, protection, and WASH needs, including increasing access to primary health care and protection services, providing psychosocial support, and distributing hygiene kits[81][82][90]. The primary barriers to accessing essential protection services include limited service availability, insecurity, poor living conditions, lack of resources, underreporting of gender-based violence (GBV), and funding shortfalls[91][92][93][94][97][100]. To address these, there is a need for increased service provision, improved security, mobile and remote services, and strengthened coordination among humanitarian actors[92][94][95][100].\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) has reached 93,715 people with food and cash-based transfers, yet the impact on food security remains unclear[111]. Inflation and food prices have risen sharply, driven by supply chain disruptions and low agricultural production, making food inaccessible for many[151][154]. Humanitarian food agencies face a US$230 million shortfall, hindering their ability to meet the needs of displaced populations[151][163].\n\nThe Haitian Government, in collaboration with the World Bank, aims to restructure operations to deliver timely results and promote access to sustainable basic services, focusing on rural areas[101]. However, the specifics of how these efforts target communities affected by gang violence are not detailed.\n\nOverall, the situation in Haiti requires urgent international support to address the humanitarian crisis, enhance security, and provide comprehensive aid to displaced individuals and host communities. The MSS mission, alongside humanitarian efforts, must be bolstered to restore stability and support the Haitian population in overcoming the challenges posed by violence and economic hardship[131][136][137][144][147][148].",

The majority, 88%, sought refuge with relatives or host families in the communes of La Chapelle, Montrouis, Petite Rivière de l'Artibonite, and Saint-Marc, while the remaining 12% found refuge in three separate sites[25][27][31][34]. Despite this large-scale displacement, the specific support mechanisms for these individuals and the resources required to sustain these arrangements remain unclear[11][12][13][14][31][32][33][34]. The municipalities of Verrettes and Saint-Marc host nearly half of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Artibonite[29], yet the sources do not provide details on how these host communities are coping with the influx or what specific support mechanisms are in place[31][32][33][34].\n\nThe displacement crisis in Haiti is exacerbated by ongoing gang violence, which has led to a 22% increase in internal displacement since June, with over 110,000 people forced to flee their homes in the last seven months[81][82][86]. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) and other humanitarian organizations face significant challenges in delivering aid due to logistical disruptions and security concerns, particularly in areas controlled by armed groups[41][248]. The World Food Programme (WFP) and other agencies are urgently calling for increased support to address the severe shortages of food, water, shelter, and medical care faced by IDPs[253][257][258].\n\nIn the Metropolitan Area of Port-au-Prince (MAPAP), where 37% of Haiti's IDPs reside, the situation is dire, with heightened risks of gender-based violence (GBV) due to poor living conditions and a lack of basic necessities[92][131][132][134]. Only 15 out of 85 IDP sites in Haiti currently receive protection services, highlighting the urgent need for increased service provision and improved security[135][137][141][142]. UNFPA and its partners are working to provide integrated sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and GBV services, but efforts are not yet at the scale needed[133][136][145][146].\n\nThe Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, led by Kenyan police forces, aims to enhance national security and establish conditions for free and fair elections[231][237]. However, the mission requires rapid deployment of its envisioned 2,500 personnel and substantial resources to effectively support the Haitian National Police and address the security challenges posed by armed gangs[238][239]. The control of up to 90% of Port-au-Prince by armed gangs significantly impacts humanitarian aid and food distribution, with road access cut off and food costs skyrocketing due to high bribes[211][215][218].\n\nTo address these challenges, humanitarian organizations are focusing on enhancing their response by addressing health, protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) needs[111][112][113]. This includes increasing access to primary health care, providing psychosocial support, and distributing hygiene kits to IDPs[112][120]. The World Bank Group is also engaged in improving early warning systems and strengthening the government's emergency response capacity[171][175]. However, the ongoing violence and control by armed groups continue to hinder these efforts, necessitating immediate and coordinated international support to make a difference for millions of Haitians at risk[161][191].",

This surge in displacement is compounded by the anticipated above-average rainfall and temperature caused by La Niña in eastern Haiti, which could lead to a rise in waterborne diseases. This situation necessitates increased medical care for both displaced individuals and host communities[11][12].\n\nTo address these challenges, a comprehensive array of resources is required. Essential services include health, protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services[13]. There is also a need for primary health care, pharmaceuticals and medicines, and the promotion of sanitation and hygiene[18]. Hygiene promotion and awareness-raising activities are crucial, covering topics such as hand hygiene, food safety, and waste management[15]. Additionally, ensuring access to clean water sources is vital[20]. The response must also address extreme weather and health crises, and include training for frontline health workers[18].\n\nEffective mobilization of these resources can be achieved through various initiatives. Project HOPE is actively responding in departments such as Sud, Nippes, and Grand'Anse[13]. Programs aimed at increasing access to primary health care and protection services are essential[18].

            "cluster_summary": "Haiti is currently grappling with an unprecedented security crisis, exacerbated by gang violence and political instability following the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021[105][108]. The Haitian National Police is intensifying its efforts to combat this crisis, deploying agents from the Temporary Anti-Gang Unit (UTAG) to reinforce existing teams on the ground[1][12]. The government is also enhancing the capacity and resources of the police force with support from international partners[17]. In a bid to restore order, Haiti has requested the transformation of a UN-backed mission into a formal UN peacekeeping mission[19].\n\nThe violence has led to significant displacement, with over 700,000 people forced from their homes, primarily due to gang activities[421]. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reports a 22% increase in internal displacement since June, with more than 110,000 people fleeing their homes in the past seven months[91][92]. Displaced individuals face severe shortages of food, water, shelter, and medical care, compounded by protection risks[103][104]. The United Nations Human Rights Office (OHCHR) has reported at least 70 deaths from gang attacks in Pont-Sonde, Artibonite department, highlighting the dire security situation[41][45][46][47].\n\nHumanitarian access is severely restricted by armed groups, complicating efforts to deliver essential aid[104][111][112]. The Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, led by Kenyan police forces, aims to enhance security and protect critical infrastructure, but faces funding and logistical challenges[106][191][192]. The mission's success is crucial for creating conditions conducive to free and fair elections and for the social and economic reconstruction of Haiti[428].\n\nThe humanitarian crisis is further compounded by gender-based violence, with women and girls particularly vulnerable in displacement sites due to poor living conditions and a lack of basic necessities[201][202][204]. UNFPA and its partners are working to provide integrated sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and GBV services, but current efforts are insufficient, with only 15 out of 85 IDP sites receiving protection services[205][207]. Food insecurity and high market prices exacerbate the vulnerability of women and girls to violence and exploitation[211][212].\n\nEfforts to address these challenges include the deployment of mobile medical units and the provision of mental health and GBV awareness activities by organizations like Project HOPE[271][272]. The World Bank is also involved in improving infrastructure and emergency response capabilities, focusing on rural areas to enhance resilience and economic opportunities[251][252][261].\n\nThe international community is called upon to provide increased financial, technical, and logistical support to address the crisis effectively[241][321]. The UN Secretary-General may offer logistical support to the MSS mission, contingent on full financial reimbursement through voluntary contributions[115]. The situation demands a multi-pronged approach that addresses the root causes of Haiti's challenges, including corruption and the need for a Haitian-led political process[118][116].\n\nIn summary, Haiti's crisis is multifaceted, involving security, humanitarian, and governance challenges. The response requires coordinated international support, enhanced security measures, and comprehensive humanitarian aid to restore stability and support the affected population.",

This situation has been exacerbated by an \"unprecedented security crisis\" following the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021, leaving citizens in fear of moving freely, particularly around Port-au-Prince[35][38][45]. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is collaborating with partners to ensure humanitarian assistance reaches those displaced in inaccessible areas, including most of Port-au-Prince[11]. However, armed groups have severely restricted access to essential humanitarian aid, deepening the crisis for vulnerable communities who face severe shortages of food, water, shelter, and medical care, alongside severe protection risks[34][41][42].\n\nThe humanitarian response in Haiti is critically underfunded, with less than 36 percent of the required funding met[22]. Local and international organizations are urgently calling for increased support to address this shortfall[22]. The Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, aimed at enhancing security, also faces a continued shortfall in funds, equipment, and logistics capabilities[36][49]. The mission currently has 410 officers, with plans for Kenya to send an additional 600 police officers, supported by Jamaican soldiers[113][119]. However, the mission must rapidly achieve the full deployment of its envisioned 2,500 personnel to be effective[114]. Calls for increased international financial and logistical assistance are urgent, as the mission lacks sufficient resources[111][112][115][118].\n\nThe transitional government requires significant resources to restore state control and ensure residents have access to basic necessities, including food, health care, and education[81][91]. More international support and coordination are needed to address these challenges effectively[81][91]. The Haitian Government is working closely with the World Bank to restructure existing operations, focusing on promoting access to sustainable basic services and strengthening resilience in more stable rural communities[71]. However, the restructuring does not specifically target communities affected by gang violence[71].\n\nThe anticipated above-average rainfall and temperature due to La Niña could lead to a rise in waterborne diseases, necessitating increased medical care for both displaced and host communities[51][52]. Resources needed include health, protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, as well as primary health care, pharmaceuticals, and hygiene promotion activities[53][58]. These resources can be mobilized through Project HOPE's response in departments such as Sud, Nippes, and Grand'Anse, and through programs that increase access to primary health care and protection services[53][58].\n\nWorld leaders gathering in New York for the United Nations General Assembly have an opportunity to provide Haiti with concrete financial, technical, and logistical commitments[61]. Immediate and coordinated action is essential to make a difference for millions of Haitians whose lives are at risk[61]. The European Union has condemned the violence, and the UN Human Rights Office expressed horror at recent gang attacks, highlighting the need for urgent international attention[92]. However, the sources do not specify the exact nature of the proposed commitments or how these entities are coordinating their efforts.\n\nThe IOM is prepared to distribute shelter kits, kitchen kits, and non-food item (NFI) kits, but logistical disruptions, such as airport and seaport closures due to security conditions, have affected the nationwide distribution of humanitarian aid[121][122][125][128]. Violent attacks and fighting linked to armed groups have further impacted these operations[128]. The international community must step up its support for Haiti's displaced populations and host communities to address these multifaceted challenges[21].",
