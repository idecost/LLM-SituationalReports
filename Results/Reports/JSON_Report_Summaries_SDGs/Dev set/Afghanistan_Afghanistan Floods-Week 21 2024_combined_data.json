    "summary": "Afghanistan is experiencing severe flooding across its western, northern, and northeastern regions, marking the largest flooding event this year and affecting thousands of families[46]. These floods have led to significant casualties, with at least 347 fatalities and over 1,651 injuries reported in Baghlan, Badakhshan, and Takhar provinces alone, and overall casualties are expected to increase[64]. The disaster has caused extensive damage to infrastructure, including approximately 9,000 homes, vital bridges, roads, health facilities, and schools, while also destroying nearly 14,000 livestock and 24,000 hectares of agricultural land, making many affected areas inaccessible[39]. Humanitarian organizations such as WHO, WFP, and UNICEF, along with various clusters (Health, Protection, Shelter, Food Security and Agriculture Cluster), are actively providing emergency response, including medical supplies, food assistance, emergency shelter, hygiene kits, and addressing critical needs like clean water, mental health support, and disease surveillance[7]. While some food prices saw a negligible decrease in May 2024, they remain significantly higher than pre-COVID levels, and acute malnutrition is above emergency thresholds in most provinces[32]. Additionally, Afghanistan continues to manage the return of over 589,700 individuals recorded up to May 18, 2024, primarily from Pakistan[17].",

            "cluster_summary": "The appreciation of the Afghani (AFN) against the US Dollar (USD) has been a significant factor contributing to persistent deflation in Afghanistan. Throughout 2023, the AFN consistently appreciated against the USD, maintaining a stable exchange rate between AFN 70 and AFN 74 per USD since November 2023[2][4][11][12][13][14]. This currency stability coincides with a notable decrease in the prices of most food items compared to the previous year, as evidenced by the continuous decline in the value of the World Food Program (WFP) in-kind food basket in Afghani from June 2022 to September 2023, with a further decrease in December 2023[14][17].\n\nIn response to the ongoing humanitarian needs, the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) has implemented a uniform approach to ensure that food assistance packages meet the minimum acceptable humanitarian standards across Afghanistan. These packages are designed to provide a minimum of 2100 kcal per person per day for emergencies, addressing the \"food gap\" after considering the populations' capacity to meet their own food needs. The design process incorporates beneficiaries' preferences and consumption habits, with feedback from partners, and is thoroughly discussed and approved by FSAC partners, donors, and humanitarian agencies[21][22][23][27].\n\nThe country has faced significant challenges due to natural disasters, with more than 30,000 people affected by floods since the beginning of the year. Recent floods have primarily impacted the northern regions, including provinces such as Faryab, Ghor, Baghlan, and Takhar, while earlier flooding affected the southern and western regions[42][43][44][45][48]. UNICEF has focused its response on these flood-affected areas, providing essential supplies like hygiene kits, family kits, blankets, tarpaulins, floor mats, teaching and learning materials, and multi-purpose cash. However, the response efforts are hindered by road damages and the destruction of main roads and bridges, necessitating alternative transportation methods to reach isolated communities[51][52][53][56][61][64][66][69].\n\nFSAC partners plan to reach flood-affected districts such as Maimana, Qaysar, Almar, Dawlat Abad, and others, with a regional FSAC team set to provide coordination and response support once the road from Hirat to Ghor is reopened[71]. Humanitarian partners face significant challenges in reaching vulnerable populations due to damaged transportation infrastructure, which isolates communities and hinders the delivery of essential supplies[81][82][83].\n\nKey protection risks in flood-affected areas include protracted displacement, mine and explosive ordnance contamination, discrimination, and denial of access to services. These risks particularly affect women, girls, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees, persons living with disabilities, and the elderly. Protection partners are mobilizing resources to address specific needs such as mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) and legal assistance for vulnerable groups[91][92][94][99][100].\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) has activated its contingency response plan, prepositioning food stocks and mobilizing within hours of the floods to distribute fortified biscuits and lipid-based nutrient supplements. Immediate distributions included high-energy biscuits, nutritional supplements, and subsidized bread rations. WFP also initiated multi-purpose cash assistance to flood-affected populations, collaborating with partners on joint distributions[101][103][105][107][110]. Long-term strategies include providing food and nutrition assistance with a 100 percent ration for two months, followed by a reduced distribution, and investing in climate adaptation projects to shield communities from climate impacts[101][103][104][105].\n\nFamilies like Hanifa's in the Behsood e Markazi district face dire economic situations due to limited job opportunities and harsh winters. Cash distribution is utilized to address these challenges, providing emergency support for winterization needs. People in Need, with funding from the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, distributed cash assistance to nearly 13,000 people in Maidan Wardak, Central Afghanistan[111][112][113][115].\n\nThe \"Goodness Train\" initiative, organized by Trkiye's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), is contributing to the humanitarian response by delivering aid to flood victims. This campaign, launched amid Afghanistan's calls for international aid, carries 619 tons of humanitarian aid, including tents, food, hygiene kits, beds, and blankets, collected by AFAD and 17 NGOs[121][122].",

            "cluster_summary": "In 2023, the Afghani (AFN) consistently appreciated against the US Dollar (USD), a trend that has been linked to persistent deflation in the country[2][4]. This appreciation coincided with a significant decrease in the prices of most food items compared to the previous year[4]. The World Food Program (WFP) reported a continuous decline in the value of its in-kind food basket in Afghani from June 2022 to September 2023, with a further decrease in December 2023[7]. Despite these economic shifts, the national average exchange rate remained relatively stable between AFN 70 and AFN 74 per USD since November 2023[1][3].\n\nIn the third week of May 2024, Afghanistan saw a downward trend in the prices of staple foods such as wheat flour, rice, and cooking oil, attributed to a marginal decline in global prices[31]. Similarly, national average fertilizer prices decreased significantly compared to the previous year, driven by a drop in global fertilizer prices and reduced domestic demand[34]. However, challenges persist, as a considerable number of returnee and host population households face difficulties related to food security, financial aid, and housing, as identified by the Multi-Sectoral Rapid Needs Assessment Teams (MRAT)[41].\n\nThe Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) employs a uniform approach to ensure that food assistance packages meet minimum humanitarian standards across Afghanistan, aiming to avoid inequality and improper resource utilization[21][22]. These packages are designed to provide a minimum of 2100 kcal per person per day during emergencies, addressing the \"food gap\" after considering the population's capacity to meet their own needs[23]. The design process incorporates beneficiaries' preferences and feedback from partners, with guidelines discussed and approved by FSAC partners, donors, and humanitarian agencies[23][27].\n\nIn response to recent floods, UNICEF Emergency Response Teams have been active in affected areas, providing water trucking and essential supplies such as hygiene kits, family kits, blankets, tarpaulins, floor mats, teaching materials, and multi-purpose cash[51][52][53][56]. However, additional resources are urgently needed to replenish emergency stockpiles, including tents, Non-Food Items (NFIs), emergency shelter repair tool kits, and plastic tarpaulin[61]. Mobilization efforts face challenges due to road damages and the destruction of main roads and bridges, necessitating alternative transportation methods to reach isolated communities[64]. Enhanced collaboration among partners is crucial for a coordinated response, involving improved information sharing and leveraging each partner's strengths to maximize impact[69].\n\nFSAC partners plan to reach flood-affected districts such as Maimana, Qaysar, Almar, and others, with a regional FSAC team set to provide coordination and support once the road from Hirat to Ghor is reopened[71]. The Early Warning Information Working Group (EWIWG) addresses forecasted weather patterns by delivering presentations on early warning information, including precipitation forecasts for the 2023-24 winter wet season, which is expected to be below average[81][82][83]. Despite below-average precipitation since November 2023, February saw significant rainfall, and average precipitation is expected from March to May 2024[81][82][84]. Above-average temperatures were forecasted for the year, contributing to floods, with snowpack below average as of March 15, 2024[82][85][86].\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) has activated its contingency response plan, prepositioning food stocks and mobilizing within hours of the floods to distribute fortified biscuits and nutrient supplements[91][93][97]. Immediate distributions included high-energy biscuits, nutritional supplements, and subsidized bread rations, with cash assistance provided where markets were functional[91][93][95]. WFP plans to continue food and nutrition assistance with a 100 percent ration for two months, followed by a reduced distribution for four months, incorporating resilience activities to mediate further loss[91][93]. WFP has called for an additional $14.5 million for emergency food and nutrition assistance and resilience-building projects[94]. The organization is investing in climate adaptation projects, including protective walls, dams, and irrigation canals, to shield communities from climate impacts[95].\n\nThe \"Goodness Train\" initiative, organized by Trkiye's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), is contributing to the humanitarian response by delivering aid to flood victims in Afghanistan[101]. This campaign, launched amid Afghanistan's calls for international aid, carries 619 tons of aid, including tents, food, hygiene kits, beds, and blankets[101][102].",

            "cluster_summary": "The recent floods in Afghanistan have caused extensive damage, particularly affecting the northern regions, including provinces such as Faryab, Ghor, Baghlan, and Takhar[12][14][15]. In the western region, several health facilities are partially or non-operational due to flood damage[1]. Baghlan province has reported several health facilities as non-operational, with significant damage to public infrastructure, including health services, in the Northeast Region[2][8]. Infrastructure damage has also been noted in Baghlan, Badakhshan, and Takhar provinces[8].\n\nIn response to these challenges, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been actively supporting affected health facilities and communities. WHO successfully transported 30 metric tonnes of essential medicines, medical kits, tents, and solar lights to Ghor province[1]. Additionally, the WHO Afghanistan Office delivered 25 metric tonnes of emergency medical kits, tents, and solar lights to Ghor province, and is mobilizing an additional 5 metric tonnes of medicines and medical supplies from its Mazar warehouse to Faryab Provincial Hospital and partners' Mobile Health Teams in affected districts of Faryab province[2].\n\nThe floods have affected more than 30,000 people across Afghanistan since the beginning of the year, with 30,055 people impacted prior to the most recent flooding episode[12][13][18]. UNICEF is focusing its response plan on the most flood-affected provinces in the northern and western regions[18]. Preliminary results from the Child Protection Area of Responsibility (CPAoR) rapid assessment indicate that 554 children are in need of child protection services, including 290 girls and 264 boys[21][22].\n\nIn Ghor province, an assessment of the Provincial Hospital revealed a critical need for medicine and medical supplies[31]. To address these needs, an additional team of four WHO members has joined response teams to provide medical and technical support[31]. WHO is distributing essential medical supplies, including trauma kits and medications, to flood-affected communities in Ghor Province[32]. Plans are underway to deploy additional Surveillance Support Teams (SSTs) to enhance active disease surveillance in affected districts, ensuring the provision of medicines, medical supplies, and consumables to health facilities for the next three months[35][37].\n\nEfforts in Faryab province include repairing and rehabilitating two destroyed health centers[41]. Health Cluster partners have deployed five Mobile Health and Nutrition Teams (MHNTs) to Bilcheragh, Pashtun Kot, and Maimana districts to provide emergency healthcare services[41]. The Health Cluster organized a three-day training on minimum standards, in collaboration with various working groups, to enhance humanitarian response standards[51].\n\nKey protection risks in flood-affected areas include protracted displacement, mine and explosive ordnance contamination, discrimination, denial of access to services, and increased risks of gender-based violence (GBV), child labor, and early marriage[71][91]. These risks particularly affect women, girls, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees, persons living with disabilities, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups[71][91]. Protection partners are mobilizing resources to address specific needs such as mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) and legal assistance for vulnerable groups[74].\n\nTo address these issues, mobile response teams are being mobilized to support GBV needs[93]. MHPSS remains a primary protection concern, with activities including psychosocial support, therapy sessions, and training for caretakers and community leaders[92]. Thirteen mobile response teams are being mobilized in Ghor, Herat, and Badghis provinces to provide MHPSS and Psychological First Aid[93]. It is essential to include at least one female health worker or female psychosocial counselor in each response team[94].\n\nA meeting focused on flood and cholera prevention measures highlighted the significant risk of cholera outbreaks due to the destruction impacting living conditions and hygiene within IDP camps[81][82]. Representatives from IDP communities are involved in providing detailed information on flood-related damage to households and latrines[81][82]. However, specific measures to prevent cholera outbreaks in IDP camps are not detailed in the provided sources.",

These challenges are compounded by restrictions on freedom of movement, a growing threat of forced evictions, and increased risks of gender-based violence (GBV), child labor, and early marriage. Additionally, there is a heightened need for mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), psychological first aid (PFA), and concerns regarding civil documentation[1][9][2][10]. These risks contribute to a shrinking protection space, disproportionately affecting women, girls, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees, persons living with disabilities, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups[1][11].\n\nTo address these pervasive issues, protection partners are actively mobilizing resources. For GBV, mobile response teams are being deployed to meet a spectrum of protection needs, including support for those affected by gender-based violence[13]. Although specific immediate actions to combat child labor are not detailed, the overall protection strategy includes addressing the needs of vulnerable children[1][11].\n\nMental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) remains a critical concern, with key activities focusing on providing psychosocial support, group and individual therapy sessions, and training for caretakers and community leaders on life skills.

In Afghanistan, there is an urgent need to replenish emergency stockpiles with tents, Non-Food Items (NFIs), emergency shelter repair tool kits, and plastic tarpaulin[11]. The mobilization of medical supplies and resources is critical to alleviate the suffering of flood-affected communities, but efforts are hampered by road damages and the destruction of main roads and bridges, which isolate communities and hinder the transportation of essential supplies[14][16]. To overcome these challenges, alternative transportation methods are necessary, and enhancing collaboration among partners is crucial for a coordinated and effective response. This involves improved information sharing, coordinated activities, and leveraging each partner's strengths to maximize impact, leading to better resource allocation and reduced duplication of efforts[11][19].\n\nA recent meeting focused on flood and cholera prevention measures, addressing the challenges posed by these issues[21][22]. The destruction significantly impacts living conditions and hygiene within IDP camps, posing a substantial risk of cholera outbreaks[21][22]. Representatives and governance structures of IDP communities are involved in providing detailed information on flood-related damage to households and latrines across multiple IDP sites[21][22]. However, specific measures to prevent cholera outbreaks in these camps are not detailed in the provided sources.\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) is responding to the recent floods in Afghanistan with both immediate and long-term strategies. In its immediate response, WFP activated its contingency response plan, prepositioning food stocks in Herat and Mazar ahead of the rains[31][37]. Within three hours of the floods, WFP's area office mobilized to distribute fortified biscuits and lipid-based nutrient supplements across affected locations[33]. Immediate distributions included high-energy biscuits, nutritional supplements, and subsidized bread rations to accessible households[31][33]. Blanket food assistance has been provided to affected populations in all accessible areas, and WFP began offering food rations and cash assistance where markets were functional[35][40]. From May 15, WFP initiated multi-purpose cash assistance of AFN 6,400 (USD 87.7) to flood-affected populations, collaborating with partners on joint distributions[40]. WFP is also setting up rub-halls (mobile storage units) as hubs and sending food trucks to a second hub[40]. Joint Assessment teams are actively reporting on priority locations, scale, and impact[37].\n\nFor long-term strategies, WFP plans to provide food and nutrition assistance with a 100 percent ration for two months, followed by a reduced distribution at 50 percent for the remaining four months[31][33]. Resilience activities will be incorporated into the recovery program to mitigate further loss[33]. WFP has called for an additional $14.5 million to support flood-affected people with emergency food and nutrition assistance and resilience-building projects[34]. Furthermore, WFP is investing in climate adaptation projects, designed and built by communities, to protect them from the impacts of the climate crisis, including the construction of protective walls, dams, and irrigation canals[35].",

            "cluster_summary": "A considerable number of returnee and host population households are facing significant challenges related to food security, financial aid, and housing, as identified by the Multi-Sectoral Rapid Needs Assessment Teams (MRAT)[1]. Humanitarian organizations are struggling to deliver aid due to extensive infrastructure damage and resulting accessibility issues[11][12][16]. The damage includes roads and bridges, with 50 bridges and 30 electricity dams damaged in Baghlan Province alone[11]. Many locations remain inaccessible for humanitarian teams, with flooding disrupting access to affected areas[11][12]. Challenging terrains, landslides, and flooded roads have further hampered relief operations[11]. Blocked roads and significant physical access issues, particularly in Guzargah Noor, Khost, and Jelga districts in Baghlan province, have made areas like Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak inaccessible by road[19][11]. Some roads in the Northeast have also been rendered inaccessible, slowing down joint assessment teams[11].\n\nThe destroyed infrastructure has severely hampered aid delivery and efforts to reach areas in need, causing delays in the initial days of the response[11][13]. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, with concerns about people trapped under collapsed buildings or structures[21][24]. Hundreds have been reported trapped in their homes beneath mud[21]. The main obstacles hindering these efforts include challenging terrains and damaged infrastructure, such as roads and bridges[23]. Safety concerns and blocked roads also posed initial challenges[21].\n\nLarge-scale infrastructure damage is reported, including structural damage to vital bridges and roads[31]. Extensive damage has occurred to roads and bridges, with 50 bridges damaged in Baghlan Province[32][33]. Public infrastructure has been critically impacted, including damage and temporary closure of the Ghor-Herat highway[34]. Roads, bridges, health facilities, and public schools have sustained damage and destruction[36]. This damage has significantly impacted humanitarian aid delivery and access, with many locations remaining inaccessible for humanitarian teams[31]. Challenging terrains and damaged infrastructure have hampered relief operations and efforts to reach areas in need of assistance[33]. Some roads across all three provinces in the Northeast have been rendered inaccessible, slowing down joint assessment teams[32]. Several roads and thoroughfares, particularly in Guzargah Noor, Khost, and Jelga districts in Baghlan province, have resulted in significant physical access issues[38]. Blocked roads caused initial challenges and delays in the first days of the response[33]. Certain areas like Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak remain inaccessible by road due to the damage caused by flooding[33]. Overall, destroyed infrastructure has hampered aid delivery and efforts to find the missing[34], and flooding has disrupted accessibility to affected areas[34].\n\nMore than 30,000 people have been affected by floods across Afghanistan since the beginning of the year[42]. Prior to the most recent flooding episode, 30,055 people had been affected[43][48]. Recent floods have mostly hit the country's northern regions, significantly impacting provinces such as Faryab, Ghor, Baghlan, and Takhar[42][44][45]. Prior to the latest flooding, the southern and western regions were mainly affected[43][44]. UNICEF is focusing its response plan primarily on the most flood-affected provinces in the northern and western regions[48].\n\nUNICEF Emergency Response Teams are on the ground supporting ongoing interventions in the flood-affected areas[52]. These interventions include water trucking and the provision of essential supplies such as hygiene kits, family kits, blankets, tarpaulins, floor mats, teaching and learning materials, High-Performance Tents to allow educational services to resume, and multi-purpose cash[51][52][53][56]. Humanitarian partners face challenges in reaching vulnerable populations in flood-affected districts due to road damages[61]. Essential supplies cannot be transported through the road network in Guzargahe Noor district, Baghlan province[61]. WHO and Health Cluster partners have difficulties reaching affected populations due to severe damage to transportation infrastructure, including roads and bridges[62]. This results in isolated communities, and movement between villages is hindered by flowing rivers[62]. Additionally, the blockade of the Herat to Ghor road is hindering the delivery of emergency supplies from Herat[62]. The destruction of main roads and bridges necessitates alternative transportation methods to reach isolated areas[63].\n\nA primary focus of a recent meeting was to discuss flood and cholera prevention measures and find solutions to challenges arising from these issues[71][72]. The level of destruction significantly impacts the overall living conditions and hygiene within IDP camps, bringing a significant risk of cholera outbreak[71][72]. Representatives and governance structures of IDP communities are involved by providing detailed information on flood-related damage to households and latrines in multiple IDP sites[71][72]. However, the provided sources do not specify the exact measures being taken to prevent cholera outbreaks in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Afghanistan.",

            "cluster_summary": "The recent floods in Afghanistan have significantly impacted over 30,000 people, primarily affecting the northern regions, including provinces such as Faryab, Ghor, Baghlan, and Takhar[22][23][24][25][28]. Prior to this, the southern and western regions were mainly affected[23][24]. The challenging terrains and damaged infrastructure, including roads and bridges, have severely hampered search and rescue operations, as well as the delivery of humanitarian aid[11][13][14]. Many locations remain inaccessible, isolating communities and complicating relief efforts[11][13][44]. Safety concerns and blocked roads have posed additional challenges[11].\n\nUNICEF has been actively responding to the crisis, focusing its efforts on the most affected provinces in the northern and western regions[28]. Their Emergency Response Teams are on the ground, providing essential supplies such as hygiene kits, family kits, blankets, tarpaulins, floor mats, teaching and learning materials, High-Performance Tents, and multi-purpose cash[31][32][33][36]. Water trucking is also part of their interventions[31]. However, additional resources are urgently needed to replenish emergency stockpiles, including tents, Non-Food Items (NFIs), emergency shelter repair tool kits, and plastic tarpaulin[41]. The destruction of main roads and bridges necessitates alternative transportation methods to reach isolated areas[41][63].\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) has activated its contingency response plan, prepositioning food stocks in Herat and Mazar ahead of the rains[91][97]. They have mobilized quickly to distribute fortified biscuits, lipid-based nutrient supplements, and subsidized bread rations to affected households[91][93]. WFP has also initiated multi-purpose cash assistance and is setting up rub-halls for storage and food distribution[100]. In the long term, WFP plans to provide food and nutrition assistance with a 100 percent ration for two months, followed by a reduced distribution for the remaining four months[91][93]. They are investing in climate adaptation projects, such as protective walls, dams, and irrigation canals, to shield communities from future climate impacts[95].\n\nThe Early Warning Information Working Group (EWIWG) has been addressing forecasted weather patterns by delivering comprehensive presentations on early warning information to cluster partners[81][82][83]. These presentations include details on precipitation forecasts, with below-average rainfall expected for the 2023-24 winter wet season, although there was a likely chance of above-average precipitation from January 2023 to March 2024[81][82]. Despite this, rainfall analysis since November 1 shows below-average precipitation[83]. Above-average temperatures have been forecasted for the entire year, contributing to the floods[85][86]. As of March 15, 2024, snowpack is below average throughout the country[82].\n\nProtection risks in flood-affected areas include protracted displacement, mine and explosive ordnance contamination, discrimination, and denial of access to services and humanitarian assistance[71]. Other risks involve restrictions to freedom of movement, forced evictions, gender-based violence, child labor, and early marriage[71]. There is a heightened need for mental health and psychosocial support, psychological first aid, and concerns regarding civil documentation[72][79][80]. These risks particularly affect women, girls, internally displaced persons, returnees, persons living with disabilities, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups[71]. Protection partners are mobilizing resources to address these specific needs[74].\n\nFSAC partners are planning to reach flood-affected people in various districts, including Maimana, Qaysar, Almar, Dawlat Abad, and others[51]. A regional FSAC team will be deployed to provide coordination and response support once the road from Hirat to Ghor is reopened[51]. However, road damages continue to hinder the transportation of essential supplies, isolating communities and complicating the movement between villages[61][62]. Enhanced collaboration among partners is crucial for a more coordinated and effective response, involving improved information sharing and leveraging each partner's strengths to maximize impact[49].",

The floods have predominantly struck the northern regions, significantly affecting provinces such as Faryab, Ghor, Baghlan, and Takhar[12][14][15]. Before this latest episode, the southern and western regions were primarily impacted[13][14]. In response, UNICEF has concentrated its efforts on the most flood-affected provinces in the northern and western regions[18].\n\nThe Early Warning Information Working Group (EWIWG) plays a crucial role in addressing forecasted weather patterns by providing comprehensive presentations on early warning information to cluster partners[21][22][23]. These presentations cover precipitation forecasts, indicating that the 2023-24 winter wet season (October 2023 to March 2024) is likely to experience below-average rainfall[21][22]. However, from January 2023 to March 2024, there was a likelihood of above-average precipitation in most of Afghanistan[21][22]. Despite this, rainfall analysis since November 1 has shown below-average precipitation[23]. The period between December 2023 and January 2024 experienced below-average precipitation, but February saw significant rainfall[24]. Average precipitation is expected from March to May 2024[21][22]. Additionally, above-average temperatures were forecasted for the entire year[25], and unseasonably warm temperatures have contributed to the flooding[26]. As of March 15, 2024, the snowpack remains below average throughout the country[22].\n\nThe negative Land Surface Temperature (LST) has potential implications for vegetation, and soil moisture is currently below average, though it is expected to improve[1]. Despite these challenges, the sources do not specify how the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) is addressing these particular impacts. Similarly, while the EWIWG provides early warning information, the sources do not detail specific measures taken to mitigate potential impacts on agriculture and food security beyond these presentations.",

The first exercise, Flow Monitoring Counting (FMC), involves a headcount of all individuals entering or leaving Afghanistan, including returnees, to assess flow volume. The second exercise, the Flow Monitoring Survey (FMS), surveys randomly selected Afghan nationals entering or leaving the country to understand their profiles, motivations, and vulnerabilities. These activities began on January 10, 2024, at four border crossing points with Iran and Pakistan and expanded to Ghulam Khan on February 11[1].\n\nIn parallel, the Border Consortium, in coordination with IOM and UNHCR Pakistan, continues to monitor the situation and will promptly relay confirmed updates. To prepare for potential future surges, the Consortium is actively working with partners on preparedness plans, reviewing their contingency plan for the Pakistan border, and assessing partners' capacity to maintain or scale up operations as needed. They have updated their 2023-2024 Border appeal and are engaging with partners and donors to anticipate gaps and ensure adequate resources are available in case of a renewed influx. Operations at Spin Boldak and Torkham Border Points have been progressively scaled up and adjusted to respond to the significant increase in returns since mid-September 2023[11][12][13].\n\nPreliminary results from the Child Protection Area of Responsibility (CPAoR) rapid assessment indicate that 554 children are in need of child protection services, with 290 girls and 264 boys identified as requiring assistance[21][22]. Meanwhile, a meeting focused on flood and cholera prevention measures, addressing challenges arising from these issues. The destruction significantly impacts living conditions and hygiene within IDP camps, posing a substantial risk of cholera outbreaks. IDP community representatives provide detailed information on flood-related damage to households and latrines across multiple sites[31][32].\n\nAfghanistan faces widespread protection risks, including protracted displacement, mine and explosive ordnance contamination, discrimination, denial of access to services, restrictions on freedom of movement, forced evictions, increased risks of gender-based violence (GBV), child labor, early marriage, and heightened needs for mental health and psychosocial support. These risks particularly affect women, girls, IDPs, returnees, persons with disabilities, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups[41]. To address these issues, mobile response teams are being mobilized to support GBV needs[43]. Although specific actions to address child labor are not detailed, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) remain key concerns. Critical activities include psychosocial support, therapy sessions, training for caretakers and community leaders, and MHPSS services. Protection Cluster partners are delivering psychological support services, positive parenting resources, and community dialogue. Thirteen mobile response teams are being mobilized in Ghor, Herat, and Badghis provinces to provide MHPSS and Psychological First Aid, with a focus on including at least one female health worker or counselor in each team[42][43][44][46][48].",
