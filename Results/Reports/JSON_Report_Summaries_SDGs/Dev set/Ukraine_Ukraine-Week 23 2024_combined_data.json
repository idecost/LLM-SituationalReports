    "summary": "Ukraine is experiencing a multifaceted crisis characterized by ongoing hostilities and significant humanitarian challenges. The Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS) continues to monitor the status of health facilities and identify service gaps[79], while nuclear safety and security, particularly at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), remain vulnerable with frequent external power outages and only one of four 750 kV power lines operational[28]. The country is still recovering from the Kakhovka Dam destruction a year prior, which resulted in devastating flooding, at least 15 deaths, damage to over 37,000 houses, and disrupted water supply for a million people[83]. Education activities in regions like Sumska, Donetska, and Kharkivska oblasts aim to restore normalcy for children amidst displacement and intensified missile attacks, with educational consultation points in Donetska oblast temporarily suspended and evacuations of families with children initiated in May 2024 due to worsening security[89][90]. Telecommunications infrastructure has also been severely affected, including a major cyberattack in December 2023 that disrupted mobile signals for millions, and temporary internet services were deployed in Odesa in May due to intensified shelling[49]. Economically, direct damage to Ukraine has reached USD 155 billion, with economic losses at USD 499 billion, and reconstruction efforts are estimated to cost over USD 486 billion[87]. Efforts are underway to address legal issues such as housing compensation[92]and provide mental health and psychosocial support to over 117,000 people[46], with calls for women's inclusive participation in reconstruction processes[5].",

            "cluster_summary": "The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has placed significant stress on services and housing stock across virtually every Oblast, as the Government of Ukraine (GoU) regains control over regions previously under occupation and on the frontlines of war. These areas have seen their infrastructure and services severely affected, leading to increased demand and strain on available resources[1]. In particular, communities along the Inhulets River faced a shortage of drinking water due to flooding of all wells and boreholes[13][14]. To mitigate this, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) purchased and distributed large quantities of water and storage containers to residents, with volunteers assisting in transporting supplies across the river by boat[11][12][13].\n\nIn Sumy, the presence of only 11 Collective Centers (CCs) is insufficient to accommodate the potential influx of internally displaced persons (IDPs), especially if the security situation deteriorates within a 20-30 km zone[21]. This highlights the broader geographical challenges in Ukraine, where the nature of the crisis is geographically specific, necessitating different interventions based on the context. For instance, Context 1 involves areas regularly attacked that require emergency activities, while Context 4 includes regions not under government control, where humanitarian access is limited, markets are non-functional, and last-mile distribution is challenging[31][32][37].\n\nTo monitor and report the effectiveness of emergency construction materials and shelter kits (ECM and ESK) distribution, specific indicators are used, such as the number of households, individuals, social facilities, and residential units supported with emergency shelter assistance[42]. Meanwhile, the Ukraine Red Cross Society (URCS) has been actively involved in external coordination forums, notably attaining co-chair status in the Cash Working Group (CWG) through the leadership and training efforts of embedded CashCap experts[51][52]. This role has provided URCS with visibility among donors and international organizations, enhancing their legitimacy in Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA)[54].\n\nDespite these advancements, perceived gaps within URCS include a lack of full cash readiness, a gap in understanding at the branch level, and the absence of sectoral cash[61][74]. To address these issues, interviewees have advocated for structured deployment with clearer objectives and increased involvement in expert selection, proposing that the National Society (NS) and CashCap be directly involved in decision-making and Terms of Reference (ToRs) drafting[70]. CashCap experts have significantly enhanced CVA skills and competence in Ukraine through daily teaching, mentoring, and capacity-building activities, leading to substantial improvements in documentation and information management[71][73][74].\n\nThe Multi-sector Needs Assessment (MSNA) data underscores the multifaceted challenges faced by various demographic groups in Ukraine, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions. The assessment highlights that the intersection of head of household gender with other vulnerabilities exacerbates households' needs, covering aspects such as gender, disability, inclusion, displacement, and humanitarian needs[81][82]. This data is crucial for prioritizing assistance based on specific household and individual characteristics, such as female-headed households, disabled person-headed households, vulnerable older people, persons with disabilities, and children without caretaker or family support[81].",

            "cluster_summary": "Following the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in southern Ukraine, middle-aged and elderly populations have faced significant healthcare challenges, including limited access to quality medicine and mental health issues such as anxiety and sleep disturbances, compounded by chronic diseases[1][7]. The overall healthcare system in the region has been severely impacted, making healthcare access increasingly difficult[1]. In the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, healthcare workers operate under dire conditions, with destroyed hospitals, a shortage of medical staff, and daily shelling[2][9][21][22].\n\nEfforts to address these challenges include the work of Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which has provided medical and humanitarian aid, including operating mobile clinics in the Kherson oblast region[2][4][11][12]. MSF continues to support the affected populations one year after the disaster, addressing mental health issues like anxiety and sleep disturbances[11][12][20]. The mobile clinics, staffed by doctors, paramedics, nurses, social workers, and psychologists, offer medical services and medicines to residents in Kherson and Mykolaiv regions[45][50][71][80].\n\nIn the village of Virivka, Kherson, where the medical facility was destroyed and looted during the Russian military occupation, Ministry of Health nurse Olha Varenyk initially conducted medical check-ups in her home. A modular structure was later installed in her yard to facilitate patient consultations[21][22]. Despite the challenges, MSF mobile clinics continue to provide essential services, including checking blood pressure and blood sugar levels and prescribing necessary medicines[58]. In Novosofiyivka, Mykolaiv region, most patients at MSF clinics are elderly women with cardiovascular diseases, for which MSF health promoters provide education[51][54][58][60].\n\nThe humanitarian response also includes addressing a shortage of drinking water in communities along the Inhulets River, where wells and boreholes were flooded[63][64]. MSF purchased large quantities of water and storage containers, distributing them to residents with the help of volunteers who transported supplies by boat[61][62][71][75]. On the inaccessible side of the river, MSF was the sole organization offering medical services and medicines at that time[53][59][71][75].\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station and subsequent flooding have emotionally impacted residents, causing distress and forcing relocations to higher ground[41][42][43]. In response, MSF continues to operate mobile clinics, providing medical services and medicines, transporting patients to hospitals, and supporting frontline hospitals with medical donations[71][80].\n\nThe broader context of the conflict in Ukraine has led to significant civilian harm, with the UN documenting violations against Ukrainian children and verifying cases of harm, although the actual extent is likely higher due to limited access to affected areas[131][132][135]. More than 600 Ukrainian children have been killed, and 1,420 injured since the escalation of Russia's invasion in February 2022[137]. The UN works with the Government to provide necessary care, and over 117,000 people have benefited from mental health and psychosocial support services in Ukraine and neighboring countries[131][135].\n\nIn response to the ongoing conflict, the Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS) monitors the availability of critical health resources and services in Ukraine, aiming to identify gaps and establish intervention priorities[121][122][128]. The system provides a summary of the status of health facilities, focusing on the availability of essential services and challenges impeding access[121].\n\nEfforts to support displaced populations include the distribution of dignity kits and psychological first aid in Kharkiv, where the Gender-based Violence (GBV) team and Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MPHSS) team provide essential services[151]. Additionally, Psychological First Aid training for faith and youth leaders in Lviv aims to foster resilience and mental well-being at the grassroots level[161][171].\n\nIn Donetska and Sumska oblasts, provisions for the wellbeing and education of evacuated children include access to online learning and safe spaces for wellbeing activities, with support for teachers facing increased challenges[191][192][193][195][205]. These efforts aim to mitigate potential learning losses and provide psychological assistance to children traumatized by the war[191][205].",

They use these interventions to train and support those most affected by the war, fostering resilience and mental well-being at the grassroots level[1]. Meanwhile, in Kharkivska oblast, efforts are underway to protect children's right to education amid disruptions caused by missile attacks and infrastructure damage. Education Cluster activities focus on supporting access to learning and wellbeing activities for children in safe spaces, especially when online education is disrupted by increased missile attacks and damages to civil infrastructure, including electricity and internet cuts[11][14][15][18].\n\nKey measures include supporting access to wellbeing and learning in safe spaces[17], providing learning for school-age evacuees[18], and facilitating offline learning and wellbeing activities for both displaced and host community children to ensure they keep up with formal schooling and minimize learning losses[11]. Teachers affected by escalations, displacement, increased workload, and challenges in supporting their students receive support, including wellbeing services[11][21]. Specific activities include the provision of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) for children, distribution of learning kits and electronic devices, establishment of safe spaces like Temporary Learning Spaces and Digital Learning Centers, and catch-up learning support services[11].\n\nIn Donetska oblast, as of May 29, 2024, the regional commission on technogenic and environmental safety and emergencies decided to evacuate families with children from specific areas, coordinating with the Coordination Headquarters for mandatory evacuation under martial law conditions. Military administration heads are tasked with pre-determining evacuation routes and transit hub availability[41][44]. Provisions for evacuated children include wellbeing and educational support in safe spaces, access to online learning amid intensified missile attacks, and offline learning and wellbeing activities when security allows, to engage with formal schooling and mitigate learning losses[42][43][45]. Teachers also receive support to manage escalations, displacement, and increased workloads[42][48]. There is a noted need for psychological assistance and rest for children traumatized by the war[41].\n\nIn Sumska oblast, tailored wellbeing and educational support services meet the needs of displaced children by providing support in safe spaces, ensuring access to online learning amidst intensified missile attacks, and facilitating offline learning and wellbeing activities when security permits[51][52][55][57]. Teachers facing similar challenges as those in other regions receive support to manage their increased workload and displacement[53][55]. Access to offline learning and wellbeing activities is contingent on the security situation, though specific criteria for determining this are not detailed[62][63].",

            "cluster_summary": "Organizations such as CARE and JurFem are actively advocating for gender equality and the rights of gender-based violence survivors in Ukraine's recovery efforts. They emphasize the importance of including Ukrainian women in decision-making processes and promoting gender equality throughout all reconstruction and recovery initiatives[1]. CARE highlights that the meaningful and direct participation of women, girls, and marginalized groups is essential to developing an equitable, inclusive, gender-responsive, and effective recovery agenda. They also stress the need to protect and ensure equitable access to services and opportunities for women to rebuild their lives[4].\n\nAt the Ukraine Recovery Conference 2024, CARE supports the broader participation of Ukrainian civil society, including women's rights and women-led organizations, and aims to integrate gender perspectives throughout the conference[3][12]. This participation is intended to ensure that economic support and inclusion in social programs for survivors are considered in discussions, decisions, and interventions[3]. JurFem, a partner organization of CARE, focuses on developing gender-oriented approaches in government and business, particularly in combating violence against women. Its Chairwoman, Khrystyna Kit, asserts that a just recovery is impossible without a gender component, emphasizing the need to strengthen the rights of gender-based violence survivors beyond just psychological and medical support[2].\n\nThe Multi-sector Needs Assessment (MSNA) data underscores the multifaceted challenges faced by various demographic groups in Ukraine, highlighting the necessity for targeted interventions. The assessment reveals that the intersection of head of household gender with other vulnerabilities exacerbates households' needs. It covers aspects such as gender, disability, inclusion, displacement, and humanitarian needs, and can be used to prioritize assistance for specific groups, including female-headed households, disabled person-headed households, vulnerable older people, persons with disabilities, and children without caretaker or family support[21][22].\n\nIn Kharkiv, the Gender-based Violence (GBV) team distributed 197 dignity kits to women and girls evacuated from areas like Vovchansk and Lyptsi. On June 4, an additional 18 dignity kits were distributed at a collective center for internally displaced persons (IDPs)[31]. A psychologist from the Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MPHSS) team assessed needs and provided psychological first aid to 43 people, while informing women and girls about available psychosocial support and inviting them to visit a women's and girls' safe space in Kharkiv. An International Medical Corps psychologist also assessed needs and offered support to displaced people at a Kharkiv dormitory[31]. However, the immediate and long-term impacts of these specific interventions in Kharkiv remain unclear, and there is no information on how these interventions can be scaled to other affected areas in Ukraine.",

Despite some interviewees expressing concerns about the URCS's readiness, particularly at the branch level and the lack of sectoral cash, significant progress has been made[24]. CashCap experts have played a pivotal role in this transformation by enhancing CVA skills and competence through documentation development, information management improvements, and comprehensive training programs[23][24].

            "cluster_summary": "The number of requests for technical documentation and cadastral numbers for plots of land designated for horticulture has surged, prompting legislative amendments to the Law on land plots allocation. These amendments, which have been passed in parliament and are awaiting the Presidential signature, extend the deadline for registering land ownership from January 1, 2025, to January 1, 2028. This extension aims to alleviate the backlog by providing owners and heirs more time to register their land, preventing it from being considered free and sold by the state if not registered by the earlier deadline [1][2][6].\n\nIn response to an urgent request from local authorities in Odesa due to intensified shelling, the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) set up temporary internet connectivity services from May 7 to 8. These services supported registration points and tents opened by local authorities to assist affected individuals. The ETC utilized its existing Remote Site on Vehicle (RSoV) and satellite solutions to deliver the service, and by May 9, all community members were registered using the new network, concluding the ETC service [11][12][13][15].\n\nThe Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) is facing significant challenges with its power lines and external power situation. The plant's electricity grid has been severely impacted by the conflict, leading to repeated losses of connections to all its power lines. Before the conflict, ZNPP had four 750 kV lines available, but only one remains, which is currently unavailable due to damage sustained earlier in the conflict, away from the site. Despite these challenges, IAEA experts were informed that nuclear safety and security are being maintained, although the ZNPP will not be re-started as long as these remain in jeopardy [31][32].\n\nIn the village of Virivka in Kherson, where the medical facility was destroyed and looted during Russian military occupation, Ministry of Health nurse Olha Varenyk initially conducted medical check-ups in her home. Recently, a modular structure was installed in her yard, allowing her to see patients there. Healthcare workers in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions generally operate amid poor conditions, including destroyed hospitals, a lack of medical staff, and daily shelling [51][52].\n\nThe agricultural sector in Ukraine faces labor shortages that curtail production, particularly in the fruit and vegetable, dairy, poultry, and honey sectors. Investments to adapt agricultural equipment for use by persons with disabilities (PWDs) could mitigate these shortages and lower unemployment among PWDs. Additionally, targeted activities to revitalize irrigation systems are being examined to increase vegetable and fruit production, especially in areas affected by the Kakhovka Dam's destruction in 2023 [41][71][81].\n\nUkraine aims to capitalize on its reconstruction, estimated to cost over USD 486 billion, to transform its economy and society to become climate resilient and inclusive. The country can contribute to Europe's economic growth and strategic autonomy through innovation, energy security, decarbonization, and diversified supply chains [101][103].\n\nTo ensure the continuity of education for children in Kharkivska oblast amid disruptions caused by missile attacks and infrastructure damage, Education Cluster activities aim to protect children's right to education. Key response activities support access to learning and wellbeing activities for children in safe spaces, especially when their online education might be disrupted by increased missile attacks and damages to civil infrastructure, including electricity and internet cuts. Specific activities include the provision of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) for children, distribution of learning kits and electronic devices, establishment of safe spaces for learning, and wellbeing support services for teachers [131][134][135][137][138].",

            "cluster_summary": "Labor shortages significantly impact Ukraine's agricultural sector, and adapting agricultural equipment for use by persons with disabilities (PWDs) could help mitigate these shortages while reducing unemployment among PWDs[1]. Meanwhile, the Ukraine Red Cross Society (URCS) has been actively involved in external coordination forums, notably Cash Working Groups (CWGs), where the embedding of CashCap experts has been instrumental. These experts have facilitated URCS's attainment of co-chair status in the CWG, enhancing their visibility among donors and international organizations and granting them legitimacy in Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA)[11][12][14]. However, challenges remain, as URCS is perceived as not fully cash ready, with gaps in understanding at the branch level and a lack of sectoral cash[21][34].\n\nTo address these gaps, interviewees have advocated for structured deployments with clearer objectives and increased involvement in expert selection[30]. Proposals include involving the National Society (NS) and CashCap directly in decision-making and drafting Terms of Reference (ToRs), along with regular partner check-ins[30]. CashCap experts have significantly enhanced CVA skills and competence in Ukraine through daily teaching, mentoring, and capacity-building activities, leading to substantial improvements in documentation and information management[31][33][34]. Their leadership and training efforts have been crucial in URCS's co-chair status in the CWG[39].\n\nThe Multi-sector Needs Assessment (MSNA) data highlights the multifaceted challenges faced by various demographic groups in Ukraine, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions. The assessment covers gender, disability, inclusion, displacement, and humanitarian needs, showing that the intersection of head of household gender with other vulnerabilities exacerbates households' needs[41][42]. This data can prioritize assistance based on specific household and individual characteristics, such as female-headed households, disabled person-headed households, vulnerable older people, persons with disabilities, and children without caretaker or family support[41].\n\nHouseholds without a person with a disability generally reported greater awareness of protection services, primarily state social services, than those with a member with a disability[56]. However, households with a person with a disability reported higher awareness of services for reporting violence against children and slightly higher awareness of psychosocial support services[51]. Awareness of gender-based violence services in Slovakia was slightly lower among households with a person with a disability compared to those without[52].\n\nIn Sumska oblast, wellbeing and educational support services are tailored to meet the needs of displaced children. These services provide safe spaces for wellbeing and educational support, ensure access to online learning amidst missile attacks, and facilitate offline learning and wellbeing activities when security permits[61][62][65][67]. Additionally, support is extended to teachers who may be displaced or face increased workloads due to escalations, helping them support their students effectively[63][65].",

            "cluster_summary": "Owners of destroyed housing in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine face significant legal challenges that hinder their ability to receive compensation through the eRecovery program. A primary issue is the difficulty in property registration, as most Bureaus of Technical Inventory (BTIs) in these areas were not relocated to government-controlled territories and have been damaged, destroyed, or looted. This situation makes it nearly impossible to obtain the necessary information for state registration of property rights (SRPR), which is a precondition for applying for compensation through the eRecovery program[3][5][6][31][32][34]. Owners who acquired property before 2013 face additional hurdles, as they often need to undergo a judicial procedure to recognize their ownership, incurring court fees and bearing the burden of proof[3][4][6][8][34].\n\nInheritance issues further complicate matters, as notaries frequently refuse to open inheritance cases for properties in occupied territories, likely due to potential legal liabilities. This forces heirs to seek court confirmation of ownership, again requiring court fees and proof[8][9]. These legal challenges directly impede the ability of owners to meet the eRecovery program's requirements, which only provides compensation for housing destruction, as assessing damage via satellite images is not feasible[4][6].\n\nEfforts to expand the eRecovery program to other territories, such as Mariupol and Bakhmut, are underway, contingent on funding support. A draft law to this effect is registered in the Parliament and is preparing for a second reading[1][2][4]. Meanwhile, the increased demand for services and housing stock in areas regaining government control is straining resources, as these regions have been severely affected by the conflict[11].\n\nIn response to the growing need for technical documentation and cadastral numbers for land plots, legislative amendments have extended the deadline for registering land ownership from January 2025 to January 2028. This extension aims to alleviate the backlog and prevent unregistered land from being considered free and sold by the state[21][26]. These amendments have passed in parliament and await the Presidential signature[26].\n\nIn Odesa, the ETC provided temporary internet connectivity services in response to intensified shelling, supporting registration points and tents set up by local authorities. This service, utilizing Remote Site on Vehicle (RSoV) and satellite solutions, ensured all community members were registered by May 9[41][42][43][45]. In Kherson, where medical facilities were destroyed, healthcare workers like nurse Olha Varenyk have adapted by conducting check-ups in modular structures installed in their yards[51][52].\n\nThe Mykolaiv region faces additional challenges due to floods that displaced unexploded ordnance (UXO), halting operations in affected areas for up to six months[71][81]. Ukraine's reconstruction, estimated to cost over USD 486 billion, aims to transform the economy to be climate resilient and inclusive, contributing to Europe's growth through innovation and energy security[91][93].\n\nGeographical contexts significantly influence the prioritization of activities, with specific zones established to address varying needs. Context 1 requires emergency activities due to regular attacks, while Context 4 faces extreme limitations in humanitarian access and market functionality[101][102][107]. Monitoring the effectiveness of emergency construction materials and shelter kits distribution involves tracking the number of households, individuals, social facilities, and residential units supported[112].\n\nIn Donetska oblast, safety strategies include switching to online formats or mobile brigades for activities, consulting authorities on security, and pre-determining evacuation routes and transit hubs[121][131]. Education Cluster activities in Kharkivska oblast focus on protecting children's right to education amid disruptions, providing mental health support, learning kits, and establishing safe spaces for learning and wellbeing[141][144][145][148].",

            "cluster_summary": "Owners of destroyed housing in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine face significant legal challenges that hinder their ability to receive compensation through the eRecovery program. A primary issue is the difficulty in property registration due to the fact that most Bureaus of Technical Inventory (BTIs) in these areas were not relocated to government-controlled territories, or were damaged, destroyed, or looted, making it nearly impossible to obtain necessary information for state registration of property rights (SRPR) [3][5][6][21][22][24]. The law mandates that state registrars receive information from BTIs for state registration of rights, but this requirement is difficult to fulfill under current conditions [5][6][21][22]. Owners who acquired property before 2013 face additional hurdles in registering their rights in the SRPR, even if they possess hard copies of title documents, often necessitating a judicial procedure to recognize ownership, which involves court fees and the burden of proof [3][4][6][8][24].\n\nInheritance issues further complicate matters, as notaries frequently refuse to open inheritance cases for properties in occupied territories, likely due to potential legal liabilities. This forces heirs to seek court confirmation of ownership, again requiring court fees and proof [8][9]. These registration difficulties directly impede an owner's ability to apply for compensation through the eRecovery program, as registration in the SRPR is a prerequisite [4][6][21][23]. The program is limited to providing compensation only for cases of complete destruction, as assessing damage via satellite images is not feasible [4][6]. Plans to expand the program to other territories, including Mariupol and Bakhmut, depend on funding support, with a draft law currently under parliamentary review [1][2][4].\n\nIn response to the increased demand for technical documentation and cadastral numbers for horticultural land plots, legislative amendments have been initiated to extend the registration deadline from January 1, 2025, to January 1, 2028. These amendments, passed by parliament and awaiting presidential approval, aim to alleviate the backlog and prevent unregistered land from being sold by the state [11][16].\n\nIn Odesa, the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) provided temporary internet connectivity from May 7 to 8 in response to intensified shelling, supporting registration points and tents set up by local authorities [31][32]. This service, utilizing Remote Site on Vehicle (RSoV) and satellite solutions, enabled the registration of all community members by May 9 [31][33][35].\n\nIn Kherson, healthcare workers face dire conditions, with destroyed hospitals and daily shelling. Nurse Olha Varenyk initially conducted medical check-ups in her home after the local medical facility was destroyed and looted. A modular structure has since been installed in her yard to facilitate patient care [41][42]. The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the urgent need to restore hospitals in Rafah to improve access and functionality [51].\n\nFlooding in the Mykolaiv region has severely impacted eight HALO minefields, displacing unexploded ordnance (UXO) to unpredictable locations, halting operations for up to six months [71][81]. The displacement of UXO poses new explosive threats, complicating efforts to ensure civilian safety.\n\nOrganizations like CARE and JurFem advocate for gender equality and the rights of gender-based violence survivors in Ukraine's recovery efforts. They emphasize the importance of including women and marginalized groups in decision-making to create an equitable recovery agenda [91][94]. CARE supports the participation of Ukrainian civil society at the Ukraine Recovery Conference 2024, aiming to integrate gender perspectives throughout the event [93][102][104]. JurFem focuses on developing gender-oriented approaches in government and business, highlighting the need for comprehensive support for gender-based violence survivors [92].\n\nThe Ukraine Red Cross Society (URCS), with the support of embedded CashCap experts, has strengthened its role in external coordination forums, notably Cash Working Groups (CWGs), attaining co-chair status. This has enhanced URCS's visibility and legitimacy as a significant cash actor, facilitating partnerships and coordination with the government and other stakeholders [111][112][114][121][122][123][130]. URCS has become the sole partner of the Ministry of Reintegration and Occupied Policy, handling various responsibilities, including registration and payment for displaced persons [125][130].\n\nThe Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS) monitors critical health resources and services in Ukraine, identifying gaps and establishing intervention priorities amid ongoing conflict [131][132][138]. The UN documents violations against Ukrainian children, with over 600 killed and 1,420 injured since the escalation of Russia's invasion in February 2022. The UN collaborates with the Ukrainian government to provide necessary care for affected children [141][142][145][147].\n\nIn Donetska oblast, strategies to ensure the safety of evacuees and humanitarian workers include switching to online formats or using mobile brigades in risky areas, conducting activities only in safe locations, and consulting authorities on security situations [171]. The regional commission has decided to evacuate families with children from specific areas, coordinating with the Coordination Headquarters for mandatory evacuation under martial law [221][224]. Provisions for the wellbeing and education of evacuated children include online learning and support for teachers, with a focus on mitigating learning losses and addressing the psychological needs of children traumatized by the war [222][223][225][228].",
