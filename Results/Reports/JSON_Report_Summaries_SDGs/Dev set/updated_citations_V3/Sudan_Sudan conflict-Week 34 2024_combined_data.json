    "summary": "Sudan is currently facing a severe humanitarian crisis marked by an ongoing 16-month civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has resulted in over 10 million displaced people and at least 18,000 deaths[16]. As of July 2024, famine is ongoing in Zamzam camp near El Fasher, with the city itself under RSF siege, and many other areas across Sudan remain at risk of famine, affecting over 25 million people or about half the population[19][14]. The country is also battling widespread health emergencies, including a confirmed cholera outbreak in Kassala and other states as of July 2024, with 11,327 cases and 316 fatalities reported by WHO, and at least 12 of 18 states experiencing multiple simultaneous outbreaks[14]. Humanitarian aid delivery is significantly hampered by heavy rains and floods, which have affected nearly 143,000 people, displaced at least 27,000, and left over 50 World Food Programme (WFP) trucks carrying aid for 500,000 people stranded due to impassable roads[13]. Despite these challenges, the Adre border crossing from Chad into Darfur, previously closed for six months, was reopened in August 2024, allowing WFP and International Organization for Migration (IOM) aid convoys to deliver supplies for tens of thousands, with WFP having additional supplies for 500,000 people ready to move through this critical route[44][36][6][31][27]. Meanwhile, Sudan's military-controlled sovereign council is engaging in diplomatic efforts, sending a delegation to Cairo for discussions with American officials regarding peace talks[17].",

            "cluster_id": "SDG 1 - No Poverty",
            "cluster_summary": "The civil war in Sudan, ongoing for approximately 16 months, has resulted in severe humanitarian consequences, including a massive hunger crisis and widespread displacement. Over 6,000 homes have been completely destroyed, with more than 10,000 damaged, leading to the displacement of nearly eight million Sudanese. Approximately half of these internally displaced individuals are being accommodated by friends, family, or strangers, highlighting the critical role of local communities in hosting those affected by the conflict [1][2]. The conflict has triggered the largest refugee crisis globally, with over ten million people displaced or forced to flee, many multiple times, and nearly 15,000 deaths reported [3].\n\nThe humanitarian situation is dire, with more than six million people facing food insecurity across Darfur and over 25 million, or about half the population, in a similar situation across the country. More than a dozen areas in Sudan are either experiencing or at risk of famine, with the World Food Programme (WFP) and other aid organizations warning of an imminent famine due to the civil war, displacement, and humanitarian access constraints [4][5][3][6][7]. Reports indicate that deaths have already occurred, particularly among infants and young children suffering from acute malnutrition [8].\n\nLocal and national humanitarian organizations in Sudan are playing a significant role in addressing the needs of displaced populations. Emergency rooms, charitable organizations, and local committees are actively providing daily meals and medical care to those affected by the conflict. Communal kitchens have stepped up to offer meals and emotional support to hundreds of thousands in Khartoum [9][10]. Approximately 150 humanitarian organizations across Sudan, including national NGOs, have reached nearly 8 million people with some form of humanitarian aid since January [10]. However, these organizations face numerous challenges, including administrative and bureaucratic hurdles imposed by warring parties, threats such as arrests, prolonged investigations, restrictions on movement, and systematic targeting. At least 22 Sudanese national aid workers have been killed, and at least 34 have been wounded or injured. Female aid workers are at high risk of sexual violence, which has been weaponized by warring factions [9][10]. The lack of safety and security is a major concern, with international humanitarian law not being respected, leading to potential attacks at any time or place without warning [11]. Restrictions on civil society organizations and grassroots committees have severely hampered their ability to gather information, assess situations, and call for assistance. Communication blackouts further limit capabilities and hinder access to funding via banking applications [9]. The Sudan humanitarian appeal, seeking US$2.7 billion, is only 33 percent funded, constraining and limiting the response efforts of national NGOs. Obstruction of aid delivery by militias is also a problem, with main supply routes often inaccessible, preventing the delivery of necessities like food and medical supplies [10][11].\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces (RSF) Civil Administration in South Darfur State has welcomed the opening of the Adre border crossing. The head of the state's civil administration, Mohamed Ahmed Hassan, announced RSF's readiness to establish strong partnerships and facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations that come to provide services and assistance to the residents [12]. The reopening of the Adre border crossing, after a six-month closure, is considered critical for preventing famine from spreading across Sudan. The first World Food Programme (WFP) food supplies for communities in Darfur crossed the Adre border from Chad, carrying essential items for 13,000 people in Kereneik, West Darfur [13][14][15][16][17]. This move aims to facilitate humanitarian aid for civilians displaced by Darfur's violence, with WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain emphasizing the need for all border crossings to be open daily to avoid widespread starvation [13][14][15][16][17].\n\nThe ongoing siege by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in El Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur State, has led to critical living conditions, with famine looming in the city. Famine conditions were confirmed in Zamzam displacement camp near Al Fasher, where people were reported to be starving to death. The city has been under RSF siege since last May, and the five-month blockade has made living conditions critical [18][19]. Access to basic services, such as safe water, is an enormous challenge in Zamzam camp, where all wells were out of service due to a lack of fuel because the area is surrounded by the RSF. Only two of the eight water wells in the camp are currently operating, and there is a struggle to bring water to the camp due to clashes, artillery shelling, and lack of funding [20].\n\nTo sustain the flow of food and nutrition assistance into Sudan, the World Food Programme (WFP) is implementing several strategies. WFP is using alternative and longer routes, such as through Chad's Tine crossing into North Darfur, and long, dangerous routes from Port Sudan that cross battle frontlines and areas controlled by different militia groups to reach communities in Darfur. A newly re-opened route is also being utilized for swift movement of supplies [21][22][23][24]. WFP is scaling up food assistance, aiming to support up to 8.4 million people by the end of the year in 14 areas either in famine or at risk of famine, largely located in Darfur, Kordofan, Khartoum, and Gezira [21][22][23][24][25]. In Khartoum, where truck access is difficult, WFP has started using alternative ways of delivering assistance, including mobile money, cash vouchers, and support for community kitchens to provide hot meals [26]. UN humanitarians continue to engage with Sudanese authorities to facilitate additional trucks for a constant supply of humanitarian goods [25].\n\nFloods are impacting the delivery of humanitarian aid in Sudan by frustrating the flow of aid. More than 50 trucks carrying an estimated 4,800 metric tons of World Food Programme (WFP) food and nutrition assistance are stuck in various locations across Sudan, unable to move towards their final destinations due to flooded and impassable roads. The rainy season exacerbates the already devastating situation, as floods force more people from their homes, increase humanitarian needs, and cut off communities from vital assistance. Heavy rains have destroyed key bridges and made it extremely difficult for aid convoys to pass through muddy, flooded roads. Nearly 143,000 people in 12 of Sudan's 18 states have been affected by the floods, with 50 people killed and at least 27,000 people displaced. Waterborne diseases such as typhoid and cholera also pose a threat to malnourished children and women [27][23]. Some forecasts warn that flooding could surpass the historic 2020 floods that hit Khartoum [27].",

This reopening is particularly significant given the severe humanitarian crisis resulting from the ongoing civil war in Sudan, which has persisted for approximately 16 months[3]. The conflict has led to a dire hunger crisis, with over six million people facing food insecurity in Darfur and more than 25 million, or about half the country's population, in a similar situation nationwide[4][6]. The World Food Programme (WFP) and other aid organizations have warned of an imminent famine, attributing it to the civil war, displacement, and constraints on humanitarian access[5][3]. Reports indicate that deaths have already occurred, especially among infants and young children suffering from acute malnutrition[8].\n\nThe conflict has also triggered the largest global refugee crisis, displacing over ten million people, many of whom have been forced to flee multiple times[3]. The power struggle has resulted in nearly 15,000 deaths[3]. To address these challenges, the WFP is implementing several strategies to sustain the flow of food and nutrition assistance into Sudan. These include using alternative and longer routes, such as through Chad's Tine crossing into North Darfur[21][22][23][24], and navigating long, dangerous routes from Port Sudan that cross battle frontlines and areas controlled by different militia groups to reach communities in Darfur[21][22][24]. A newly re-opened route is also being utilized for the swift movement of supplies[23]. The WFP aims to scale up food assistance to support up to 8.4 million people by the end of the year in 14 areas either in famine or at risk of famine, primarily located in Darfur, Kordofan, Khartoum, and Gezira[21][22][23][24][25]. In Khartoum, where truck access is difficult, the WFP has started using alternative methods of delivering assistance, including mobile money, cash vouchers, and support for community kitchens to provide hot meals[26]. UN humanitarians continue to engage with Sudanese authorities to facilitate additional trucks for a constant supply of humanitarian goods[25].\n\nHowever, the delivery of humanitarian aid is being severely impacted by floods, which have frustrated the flow of aid[23]. More than 50 trucks carrying an estimated 4,800 metric tons of WFP food and nutrition assistance are stuck in various locations across Sudan, unable to move towards their final destinations due to flooded and impassable roads[27]. The rainy season exacerbates the already devastating situation, as floods force more people from their homes, increase humanitarian needs, and cut off communities from vital assistance[27]. Heavy rains have destroyed key bridges and made it extremely difficult for aid convoys to pass through muddy, flooded roads[27]. Nearly 143,000 people in 12 of Sudan's 18 states have been affected by the floods, with 50 people killed and at least 27,000 people displaced[27]. Waterborne diseases such as typhoid and cholera also pose a threat to malnourished children and women[27]. Some forecasts warn that flooding could surpass the historic 2020 floods that hit Khartoum[27].\n\nThe reopening of the Adre border crossing, which had been closed since February, is seen as critical for preventing famine from spreading across Sudan[13][14]. The crossing was reopened by Sudanese authorities after a six-month closure, and it was announced on August 15 that the Adre border crossing would be opened for the first inter-agency cross-border transport of vital humanitarian aid through this corridor since February[13][14][19][15]. The first WFP food supplies for communities in Darfur crossed the Adre border from Chad, with WFP trucks carrying sorghum, pulses, oil, and rice for 13,000 people in Kereneik, West Darfur[13][14][16][17]. UNHCR also had four trucks of Core Relief Items as part of the first inter-agency convoy on August 21[15]. The UN Secretary-General commended the Sudanese authorities on August 17 for reopening the Adre border crossing, recognizing it as a direct route for humanitarian aid[15]. WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain emphasized that the reopening is vital for getting lifesaving aid to millions and stressed the need for all border crossings to be open daily to avoid widespread starvation[13][14][15][16][17]. The Adre border crossing was announced to be open for a three-month period[28].\n\nDespite these efforts, the ongoing siege by the RSF in El Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur State, has led to critical living conditions[18]. Famine is looming in the city[18], and famine conditions were confirmed in Zamzam displacement camp near Al Fasher, where people were reported to be starving to death[18][19]. The city has been under RSF siege since last May, and the five-month blockade has made living conditions critical[18]. Access to basic services, such as safe water, is an enormous challenge in Zamzam camp[20]. All wells at the camp were out of service due to a lack of fuel because the area is surrounded by the RSF[20]. Only two of the eight water wells in the camp are currently operating, and there is a struggle to bring water to the camp due to clashes, artillery shelling, and lack of funding[20].",

            "cluster_summary": "Local and national humanitarian organizations in Sudan are playing a crucial role in addressing the needs of displaced populations, with approximately 150 organizations, including national NGOs, reaching nearly 8 million people with some form of humanitarian aid since January[10][29]. These efforts include providing daily meals and medical care through emergency rooms, charitable organizations, and local committees, as well as communal kitchens offering meals and emotional support to hundreds of thousands in Khartoum[9][10]. Despite these efforts, roughly half of the nearly eight million Sudanese internally displaced by the conflict are being accommodated by friends, family, or strangers, underscoring the significant role of local communities in hosting[2].\n\nHowever, these organizations face numerous challenges, including obstacles imposed by warring parties such as administrative and bureaucratic hurdles[9]. Humanitarian workers and volunteers are threatened with arrests, prolonged investigations, restrictions on movement, systematic targeting, and confiscation of aid[9]. At least 22 Sudanese national aid workers have been killed, and 34 wounded or injured while on duty, with female aid workers at high risk of sexual violence, weaponized by warring factions[9][10]. The lack of safety and security is a major concern, as international humanitarian law is not respected, leading to potential attacks at any time or place without warning[11]. Restrictions on civil society organizations and grassroots committees severely hamper their ability to gather information, assess situations, and call for assistance, while communication blackouts further limit capabilities and hinder access to funding via banking applications[9]. The Sudan humanitarian appeal, seeking US$2.7 billion, is only 33 percent funded, constraining the response efforts of national NGOs[10]. Additionally, militias obstruct aid delivery, and main supply routes can be inaccessible, preventing the delivery of necessities like food and medical supplies, with the rainy season further complicating access due to heavy rains and flash floods[10][11].\n\nThe health crisis in Sudan is exacerbated by a cholera outbreak, with the World Health Organization (WHO) reporting 11,327 cases and 316 fatalities[30]. The outbreak, attributed to poor environmental conditions and contaminated drinking water, is predominantly in eastern Sudan's Kassala, with officially declared outbreaks in Kassala and several other states[30][31]. The Sudanese Ministry of Health, in cooperation with WHO and UNICEF, has implemented measures to address the outbreak, including a cholera vaccination campaign targeting 51,000 people in Wad El Helew[32][33]. However, vaccines quickly ran out due to the high number of displaced individuals, prompting calls for additional supplies[33]. The ongoing conflict has also led to an increase in dengue and meningitis cases[30].\n\nThe conflict has had a devastating impact on civilian infrastructure, with over 75% of health facilities in conflict-affected states rendered non-functional[34][35]. Since April 2023, 88 attacks on healthcare, including on health facilities, ambulances, transport, assets, patients, and health workers, have been verified, resulting in 55 deaths and 104 injuries[34][35]. Specific instances of airstrikes impacting health facilities include the bombing of a major hospital in El Daein, killing at least 15 people, and an airstrike on a vaccination center west of El Daein Teaching Hospital[36][37]. In Al-Koma, a clinic's lack of necessary equipment contributed to the deaths of a woman and her four children admitted with injuries after airstrikes[37].\n\nThe ongoing siege by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in El Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur State, has led to critical living conditions, with famine looming in the city and confirmed famine conditions in Zamzam displacement camp near Al Fasher, where people are reported to be starving to death[18][19]. The five-month blockade has made living conditions critical, with access to safe water being an enormous challenge in Zamzam camp[18][20]. All wells at the camp were out of service due to a lack of fuel, with only two of the eight water wells currently operating, and there is a struggle to bring water to the camp due to clashes, artillery shelling, and lack of funding[20].",

In response, the Sudanese Ministry of Health, in collaboration with state health ministries, the World Health Organisation (WHO), and UNICEF, has launched an extensive campaign to combat the epidemic[33]. This includes a cholera vaccination campaign in Wad El Helew, targeting 51,000 people, although vaccines quickly ran out due to the high number of displaced individuals, prompting calls for additional supplies[32][33]. Despite these efforts, challenges remain, as the health ministry continues to work on delivering chlorine and implementing sanitary procedures, though specific obstacles are not detailed[1][38].\n\nThe situation is further complicated by a new wave of cholera threatening displaced communities, particularly in areas hosting refugees in Kassala, Gedaref, and Jazirah states[39]. Concurrently, floods are severely impacting the delivery of humanitarian aid, with over 50 trucks carrying 4,800 metric tons of World Food Programme (WFP) food and nutrition assistance stuck due to impassable roads[27][23]. The rainy season has exacerbated the situation, displacing nearly 143,000 people across 12 of Sudan's 18 states, with 50 fatalities and at least 27,000 displaced[27]. The floods have destroyed key infrastructure, making it difficult for aid convoys to reach affected areas, and have increased the risk of waterborne diseases like typhoid and cholera, particularly threatening malnourished children and women[27].\n\nIn North Darfur State, the ongoing siege by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in El Fasher has led to critical living conditions, with famine looming in the city and confirmed famine conditions in Zamzam displacement camp, where people are reportedly starving to death[18][19].

Female aid workers are at high risk of sexual violence, which has been weaponized by warring factions[9]. The lack of safety and security is a major concern, with international humanitarian law not being respected, leading to potential attacks at any time or place without warning[11]. Restrictions on civil society organizations and grassroots committees have severely hampered their ability to gather information, assess situations, and call for assistance, while communication blackouts further limit capabilities and hinder access to funding via banking applications[9]. \n\nMoreover, the Sudan humanitarian appeal, seeking US$2.7 billion, is only 33 percent funded, which constrains and limits the response efforts of national NGOs[10]. Obstruction of aid delivery by militias is also a problem, as main supply routes can be inaccessible, preventing the delivery of necessities like food and medical supplies[11]. The rainy season further complicates access due to heavy rains and flash floods[11]. Despite these significant challenges, the dedication of local and national organizations remains a vital lifeline for millions in Sudan[10][29].",

Approximately half of these displaced individuals are being accommodated by friends, family, or strangers, while many others face the loss of livelihoods and access to farmland, resulting in hunger and critical food shortages[1][2][41]. The situation is further exacerbated by the rainy season, which has caused severe flooding, impacting the delivery of humanitarian aid. More than 50 trucks carrying an estimated 4,800 metric tons of World Food Programme (WFP) food and nutrition assistance are stranded due to flooded and impassable roads, preventing them from reaching their destinations[27][23]. The floods have affected nearly 143,000 people across 12 of Sudan's 18 states, resulting in 50 deaths and displacing at least 27,000 people[27]. The destruction of key bridges and the muddy, flooded roads have made it extremely difficult for aid convoys to pass, cutting off communities from vital assistance[27]. Additionally, waterborne diseases such as typhoid and cholera pose a significant threat to malnourished children and women[27]. \n\nIn the midst of these natural disasters, the Sudanese army has conducted airstrikes in North Darfur, leading to civilian casualties and further damage to infrastructure and livestock[40]. In Al-Koma, a town 75 km from El Fasher, a woman and her four children were killed by airstrikes after being admitted to Al-Koma Rural Hospital, which lacked the necessary equipment to treat their injuries[37]. The airstrikes also targeted sheep pastures on the outskirts of Al-Koma, resulting in the death of over 150 livestock[37]. Eyewitnesses reported that only civilian areas were hit, with no Rapid Support Forces (RSF) gathering points affected[37]. In the Abu Hamira area of Umm Kadada, 168 km east of El Fasher, Sudanese army warplanes launched airstrikes, with two Sukhoi planes firing shells near a water station in the Telis area[40]. Additionally, air raids on Al-Tawisha in North Darfur resulted in the deaths and injuries of dozens of civilians[37]. \n\nThe compounded effects of conflict and natural disasters have left many displaced people waiting to travel to their final destinations due to a lack of resources, while forecasts warn that flooding could surpass the historic 2020 floods that hit Khartoum[2][27].

The airstrikes also targeted sheep pastures on the outskirts of Al-Koma, resulting in the death of over 150 livestock[37]. Eyewitnesses confirmed that the bombings exclusively affected civilian areas, sparing any Rapid Support Forces (RSF) gathering points[37].\n\nFurther east, in the Abu Hamira area of Umm Kadada, 168 km from El Fasher, the Sudanese army continued its air assault[40]. Two Sukhoi planes were reported to have fired shells near a water station in the Telis area[40]. Additionally, air raids were conducted on Al-Tawisha in North Darfur, leading to the death and injury of dozens of civilians[37]. These coordinated attacks highlight the severe impact on civilian life and infrastructure in the region[40][37].",

            "cluster_summary": "The ongoing civil war in Sudan, which has persisted for approximately 16 months, has led to severe humanitarian consequences, including a massive hunger crisis and widespread displacement. Over 25 million people, or about half the population, face food insecurity, with more than six million affected in Darfur alone. The World Food Programme (WFP) and other aid organizations have warned of an imminent famine, attributing it to the civil war, displacement, and constraints on humanitarian access. Reports indicate that deaths have already occurred, particularly among infants and young children suffering from acute malnutrition[4][5][3][6][8][7].\n\nLocal and national humanitarian organizations in Sudan have been pivotal in addressing the needs of displaced populations, with approximately 150 organizations, including national NGOs, reaching nearly 8 million people with some form of humanitarian aid since January. These efforts are supported by emergency rooms, charitable organizations, and local committees that provide daily meals and medical care to those affected by the conflict. Communal kitchens in Khartoum have also stepped up to offer meals and emotional support to hundreds of thousands[2][9][10][29]. Despite these efforts, the organizations face numerous challenges, including administrative and bureaucratic hurdles imposed by warring parties, threats to humanitarian workers, and a lack of safety and security. At least 22 Sudanese national aid workers have been killed, and 34 wounded or injured, with female aid workers at high risk of sexual violence. Restrictions on civil society organizations and communication blackouts further limit their capabilities, while the Sudan humanitarian appeal remains only 33 percent funded, constraining response efforts[9][10][11].\n\nThe conflict has triggered the largest refugee crisis globally, with over ten million people displaced or forced to flee, many multiple times. The power struggle has resulted in nearly 15,000 deaths, with Sudanese army airstrikes in North Darfur causing civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure and livestock. In Al-Koma, a woman and her four children were killed by airstrikes, and over 150 livestock were lost. Eyewitnesses reported that only civilian areas were hit, with no Rapid Support Forces (RSF) gathering points affected[3][40][37].\n\nHumanitarian organizations face additional challenges in delivering aid to famine-stricken areas due to delays in access, perilous routes crossing battle frontlines, and obstruction by warring parties. The severe autumn rainy seasons have disrupted major roads and destroyed bridges, further hindering aid delivery. However, the reopening of the Adre border crossing has significantly influenced these efforts. Announced on August 15, the crossing allows for the first inter-agency cross-border transport of vital humanitarian aid since February. WFP trucks carrying food supplies for 13,000 people in West Darfur crossed the border, and UNHCR also participated in the first inter-agency convoy. The reopening is considered critical for preventing famine from spreading across Sudan, with the UN Secretary-General commending the move as a direct route for humanitarian aid[13][14][28][19][15][16][17].\n\nThe conflict has devastated civilian infrastructure, rendering over 75% of health facilities in conflict-affected states non-functional. Since April 2023, 88 attacks on healthcare, including on facilities, ambulances, and health workers, have been verified, resulting in 55 deaths and 104 injuries. The destruction of power, water, and sanitation infrastructure has increased the risk of diseases and contributed to famine risk. Specific instances of airstrikes impacting health facilities include the bombing of a major hospital in El Daein, killing at least 15 people, and an airstrike on a vaccination center west of El Daein Teaching Hospital. Patients and medics evacuated the hospital after it was bombed, and in Al-Koma, a clinic's lack of necessary equipment contributed to the deaths of a woman and her four children[34][35][36][37].\n\nEfforts to address the crisis include a roadmap initiative presented to the leadership of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) 22nd Infantry Division and the RSF in West Kordofan. The military parties have expressed strong support for the initiative, although formal talks have not yet occurred. The RSF Civil Administration in South Darfur State has welcomed the opening of the Adre border crossing and expressed readiness to establish strong partnerships to facilitate humanitarian work[42][12].",

Humanitarian workers and volunteers also face threats ranging from arrests and prolonged investigations to restrictions on movement, systematic targeting, and confiscation of the desperately needed aid they bring to assist citizens impacted by the war.The numerous restrictions imposed on civil society organisations and grassroots committees serving local communities have severely hampered their ability to gather information, assess the situation, and issue calls for assistance. Communication blackouts have further compounded these challenges by limiting communication capabilities and hindering access to funding via banking applications, which have become the sole means of transferring money.The local and foreign media face a similar predicament, unable to adequately report on the humanitarian crisis affecting refugees and displaced people due to restrictions, communication disruptions, and internet outages.

            "cluster_summary": "Local and national humanitarian organizations in Sudan are playing a crucial role in addressing the needs of displaced populations, with approximately 150 organizations, including national NGOs, reaching nearly 8 million people with some form of humanitarian aid since January[10][29]. These efforts include providing daily meals and medical care through emergency rooms, charitable organizations, and local committees, as well as communal kitchens offering meals and emotional support to hundreds of thousands in Khartoum[9][10]. Additionally, about half of the nearly eight million Sudanese internally displaced by the conflict are being accommodated by friends, family, or strangers, underscoring the significant role of local communities in hosting[2].\n\nHowever, these organizations face numerous challenges, including obstacles imposed by warring parties such as administrative and bureaucratic hurdles[9]. Humanitarian workers and volunteers are threatened with arrests, prolonged investigations, restrictions on movement, systematic targeting, and confiscation of aid[9]. At least 22 Sudanese national aid workers have been killed, and 34 have been wounded or injured while on duty[10]. Female aid workers are at high risk of sexual violence, which has been weaponized by warring factions[9]. The lack of safety and security is a major concern, with international humanitarian law not being respected, leading to potential attacks at any time or place without warning[11]. Restrictions on civil society organizations and grassroots committees have severely hampered their ability to gather information, assess situations, and call for assistance, while communication blackouts further limit capabilities and hinder access to funding via banking applications[9]. The Sudan humanitarian appeal, seeking US$2.7 billion, is only 33 percent funded, constraining and limiting the response efforts of national NGOs[10]. Obstruction of aid delivery by militias is also a problem, with main supply routes often inaccessible, preventing the delivery of necessities like food and medical supplies[10][11]. The rainy season further complicates access due to heavy rains and flash floods[11].\n\nFloods are significantly impacting the delivery of humanitarian aid in Sudan, with more than 50 trucks carrying an estimated 4,800 metric tons of World Food Programme (WFP) food and nutrition assistance stuck in various locations due to flooded and impassable roads[27][23]. The rainy season exacerbates the situation, as floods force more people from their homes, increase humanitarian needs, and cut off communities from vital assistance[27]. Heavy rains have destroyed key bridges, making it extremely difficult for aid convoys to pass through muddy, flooded roads[27]. Nearly 143,000 people in 12 of Sudan's 18 states have been affected by the floods, with 50 people killed and at least 27,000 people displaced[27]. Waterborne diseases such as typhoid and cholera pose a threat to malnourished children and women[27]. Some forecasts warn that flooding could surpass the historic 2020 floods that hit Khartoum[27].\n\nThe Federal Emergency Operations Centre is addressing the cholera epidemic through an extensive campaign in cooperation with state health ministries, the World Health Organisation (WHO), and UNICEF[33]. Despite these efforts, the challenges posed by the floods remain significant, with no specific measures clearly stated to address them.\n\nThe reopening of the Adre border crossing has significantly influenced humanitarian efforts. Closed in February, the Adre route forced the WFP to use a longer route into North Darfur through the Tine crossing in Chad[43]. However, with the reopening announced on August 15, the first inter-agency cross-border transport of vital humanitarian aid through this corridor since February was facilitated[13][14][19][15]. WFP trucks carrying food supplies for communities in Darfur crossed the Adre border from Chad, and UNHCR also had four trucks of Core Relief Items as part of the first inter-agency convoy on August 21[13][14][15][16][17]. This reopening is considered critical for preventing famine from spreading across Sudan, with the UN Secretary-General commending the Sudanese authorities for this move[13][14][28][15]. WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain emphasized the importance of keeping all border crossings open daily to avoid widespread starvation[13][14][15][16][17]. The Adre border crossing is announced to be open for a three-month period[28].",
