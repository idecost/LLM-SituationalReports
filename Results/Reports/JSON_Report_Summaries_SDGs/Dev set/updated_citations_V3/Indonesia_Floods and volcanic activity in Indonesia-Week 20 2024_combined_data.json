    "summary": "Indonesia is currently experiencing multiple natural disasters, primarily severe flash floods and cold lava flows from Mount Marapi in West Sumatra, which began on May 11[2]. The death toll from these events has risen to 67, with 20 people still missing, and earlier reports indicated 57 victims found dead and 22 missing[10]. These disasters have affected at least six regencies and cities, including Agam and Tanah Datar, destroying hundreds of homes and damaging public infrastructure[3]. President Joko Widodo has directed authorities to accelerate the rebuilding of damaged infrastructure, while rescue operations involve thermal drones, excavators, and manual searching for survivors[11]. Weather modification technology is being deployed to reduce rainfall intensity, and a state of emergency is in effect until May 26[22]. Concurrently, Mount Ibu in North Maluku Province has seen a series of eruptions since April, with a significant eruption on May 27 spewing ash 6km high, prompting the evacuation of residents from seven nearby villages and over 12,000 people from a nearby island[15][11][12]. The volcano's alert level has been elevated to IV, and aviation warnings have been issued[11]. Additionally, earlier in May, flooding in Ogan Komering Ulu, South Sumatra, affected 1,695 families and displaced 257, causing substantial material losses[14].",

Authorities have communicated the need for evacuation, leading to the relocation of people from seven nearby villages and more than 12,000 individuals on a nearby island[11][10][12]. BPBD Halmahera Barat is on-site, implementing an emergency alert status, \"Siaga Darurat\"[9]. Residents evacuated due to the eruption were transported in pickup trucks and accommodated in emergency tents for the night[2].\n\nIn response to the volcanic threat, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) and PVMBG are planning to train teams of residents in each village surrounding the volcano to assist with potential evacuations[13].

The BNPB has been attempting to redirect rain away from rivers on volcano slopes following forecasts of moderate to heavy precipitation[27].\n\nIn another region, the danger zone around Mount Marapi has been extended westward by 3 kilometers from the summit due to lava flow moving toward Amakaka, impacting the village[28]. In Ogan Komering Ulu, 1,695 families were affected, with 257 families displaced, and material losses included 1,695 housing units, 4 worship facilities, a broken suspension bridge, and 10 hectares of agricultural land[3][4].\n\nThe death toll from flash floods and cold lava flow in West Sumatra has risen to 67, with ongoing search and rescue operations involving local rescuers, police, and military personnel[14][18][16][20].

            "cluster_summary": "In response to the eruption of Mount Ibu, the Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (PVMBG) elevated the volcano's alert status to Alert Level IV, prompting the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) and BPBD Halmahera Barat to implement an emergency alert status, \"Siaga Darurat\" [9]. This escalation led to the evacuation of residents from seven nearby villages, although the exact number of evacuees from these villages remains unspecified. Additionally, authorities evacuated more than 12,000 people from a nearby island [12][11][10][1]. Evacuees were transported in pickup trucks and accommodated in emergency tents for the night [2]. To further support evacuation efforts, the BNPB and PVMBG are planning to train residents in each village surrounding the volcano [13].\n\nIn parallel, the Indonesian government is addressing infrastructure rebuilding in West Sumatra, with President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo urging authorities to expedite the reconstruction of damaged public infrastructure. Most roads and temporary bridges have been rebuilt, although some remain under construction. Heavy equipment, such as excavators, is being used to clear debris and build temporary bridges, like the one constructed over a river in Nagari Sungai Bambu, Tanah Datar regency, to facilitate aid delivery to flood victims [22][21][23].\n\nThe BNPB is also employing weather modification technology, specifically cloud seeding, to manage rainfall intensity in disaster-struck areas. This technology aims to make clouds release rain earlier, thereby reducing the rainfall's impact when it reaches affected regions. This effort is in response to forecasts of moderate to heavy precipitation by the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) [27][26][29].\n\nIn another region, the danger zone around Mount Marapi has been extended westward by 3 kilometers due to lava flow moving toward Amakaka, impacting the village as the flow reached 1,200 meters from the summit [28]. Meanwhile, in Ogan Komering Ulu, 1,695 families were affected, with 257 families displaced, and significant material losses reported, including damage to housing, worship facilities, and agricultural land [3][4].\n\nThe death toll from flash floods and cold lava flow in West Sumatra has risen to 67, with ongoing search and rescue operations involving local rescuers, police, and military personnel. As of Thursday, 20 people remain missing, with previous reports indicating 25 missing, five of whom were later found dead [19][17][14][18][16][20][15].\n\nThe Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) and the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre) are enhancing disaster risk reduction and humanitarian assistance throughout the ASEAN region. Their collaboration includes the Disaster Monitoring and Response System (DMRS), which provides near-real-time impact analysis and actionable information for various hazards, serving all ASEAN Member States. The AHA Centre, located in Jakarta, Indonesia, facilitates disaster management coordination among ASEAN Member States, offering early warning and impact analysis through DMRS [24][25].\n\nLastly, the provided sources describe the adverse effects of torrential rain and prolonged drought on pepper farming, leading to dying plants, no harvest, and lower quality produce. However, these agricultural impacts are not specified to have occurred in Indonesia [6][7][8].",

            "cluster_summary": "The ongoing volcanic activity of Mount Ibu has prompted significant emergency measures and evacuations. The Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (PVMBG) has elevated the alert status of Ibu Volcano to Alert Level IV due to recent volcanic activity, which has been communicated through various channels to ensure public safety and preparedness [9]. In response to the heightened alert, the country's volcanology agency has issued warnings to aviation authorities managing local flights [10]. Authorities have also initiated evacuations, moving people from seven nearby villages and more than 12,000 individuals from a nearby island to safer locations [11][10][12][1]. BPBD Halmahera Barat is actively on-site, implementing an emergency alert status known as \"Siaga Darurat\" to manage the situation [9].\n\nIn addition to these measures, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) and PVMBG are planning to train residents in each village surrounding the volcano to assist with potential future evacuations [13]. The BNPB is also employing weather modification technology, specifically cloud seeding, to redirect rain away from rivers on the volcano's slopes. This effort is in response to forecasts of moderate to heavy precipitation by the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) [27][26][29].\n\nMeanwhile, in another region, the danger zone around Mount Marapi has been extended westward by 3 kilometers from the summit due to lava flow moving toward Amakaka. This flow has reached 1,200 meters from the summit, impacting the village of Amakaka [28]. In Ogan Komering Ulu, 1,695 families have been affected by natural disasters, with 257 families displaced. The material losses include damage to 1,695 housing units, 4 worship facilities, a broken suspension bridge, and 10 hectares of agricultural land [3][4]. To support those affected by the cold lava flood from Mount Marapi, West Sumatra Police's elite Mobile Brigade Brimob has established a field kitchen in Sungai Pua village, Agam district, to provide cooked meals [5].\n\nAdditionally, the agricultural sector is facing challenges due to adverse weather conditions. Torrential rain and prolonged drought have severely impacted pepper farming, leading to dying plants, no harvest, and lower quality produce. Farmers have reported significant losses, with one expecting no harvest this year compared to nine tonnes last year, and another noting that the little harvest available is of lower quality, affecting future yields for 2024 and 2025 [6][7][8]. However, the sources do not specify that these agricultural impacts occurred in Indonesia.",
