    "summary": "Jamaica is facing widespread destruction and significant humanitarian needs after Hurricane Beryl made landfall as a Category 5 storm on July 3rd[32]. Southern coastal areas, including parishes like St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, Manchester, Westmoreland, and Hanover, were most severely impacted, suffering extensive damage to telecommunications, water, electricity, health infrastructure, housing, public buildings, agriculture, and fishing livelihoods[54]. Many communities remain without access to clean water, sanitation, and electricity, with 70% of National Water Commission customers initially without water and power restoration in the worst areas projected to take four to eight weeks[43]. Two deaths have been confirmed, and approximately 1,876 people, including 113 children, are in shelters[20]. In response, the Government of Jamaica declared a disaster area and launched the Relief Emergency Assistance and Community Help (REACH) program for recovery, focusing on distributing food and essential supplies, restoring utilities, and supporting housing and economic recovery, while formally accepting support from the United Nations[62]. The UN, through its Resident Coordinator and the activated UN Emergency Technical Team (UNETT), which is co-shared by UNICEF and WFP, has deployed UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) teams for joint assessments and is coordinating international assistance, including a US$4 million allocation from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) for Jamaica and other affected Caribbean nations[62]. Agencies like UNICEF are providing prepositioned water, hygiene, and dignity supplies, and planning for disease prevention, psycho-social support, and cash transfers, while FAO is conducting damage assessments using advanced technology to aid agricultural recovery[36]. Humanitarian access and communication remain challenging in affected areas, hindering aid delivery and assessment efforts[25].",

            "cluster_summary": "In response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Beryl, the United Way of Jamaica (UWJ) launched a Farmer's Rehabilitation Fund (FRF) with the goal of raising up to 20 million to support affected farming communities, particularly in the parishes of Clarendon, St Elizabeth, and Manchester, which were severely impacted by the hurricane[1]. The FRF aims to provide critical resources such as seeds, equipment, and financial aid to help farmers restore their livelihoods[3]. Seprod and Musson Foundations have committed to donating 2 million to this fund[2]. The UWJ is calling on private and public organizations to collaborate in strengthening efforts to provide effective assistance through the FRF initiative[3].\n\nThe agricultural sector in Jamaica suffered significant damage, estimated at over US$6.4 million (JMD1 billion), raising concerns about food security and the livelihoods of small producers[14][91]. The hurricane caused extensive damage to crops, including vegetables and fruits, and affected the livestock and fisheries sectors, leading to losses in fishing capacity, damage to vessels, support infrastructure, and fishing equipment[11][14]. This devastation has resulted in crop and infrastructure damage, livestock losses, soil erosion, and economic challenges for farmers, impacting food security and the livelihoods of those dependent on agriculture[12][19].\n\nOngoing rains and debris have obstructed access in Jamaica, delaying aid delivery and assessments[21][41]. Humanitarian access is further challenged by flooding, debris from fallen trees, landslides, and infrastructural damage[27][46]. Recovery efforts include \"debushing and the carting away of debris\" and \"cleaning and desilting of drains\"[26]. The chief of defence staff has mobilized the Disaster Assistance and Recovery Team and other supporting units, including engineers, to assist with rebuilding and recovery in the hardest-hit areas, such as Rocky Point and Portland Cottage[22]. Social workers are conducting daily assessments and providing support, including mattresses, food packages, and tarpaulins, to impacted residents[26].\n\nThe REACH (Relief Emergency Assistance and Community Help) programme is structured to ensure the equitable distribution of food and essential supplies through a transparent and non-partisan process[51]. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security has been distributing care packages containing enough food for a family of four for four days[51]. An initial allocation of $5 million was provided for welfare activities, including food distribution, with an additional $4 million allocated to all 63 constituencies to assist in the recovery effort[52][55]. The criteria for resource allocation involve a transparent assessment process conducted by the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM), utilities, and public infrastructure[57][58]. Support is directed to communities with the greatest damage, such as Rocky Point and Portland Cottage[57].\n\nThe Ministry of Labour and Social Security, along with teams from other ministries and NGOs like Red Cross and Food for the Poor, is committed to leaving no one behind and encourages all Jamaicans to join in the rebuilding effort[121][124][132]. These teams are going house to house to deliver immediate relief supplies and conduct initial damage assessments[121][132]. The Ministry has also provided hygiene kits and water, and efforts are being made to utilize community leaders to work with Members of Parliament[134]. The relief outreach is supported by NGOs, partners, and volunteers, with a call for Jamaicans to volunteer and donate supplies[122][124][131].\n\nTo address the significant damage to livelihood infrastructure, several measures are being implemented. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is conducting rapid needs assessments and preparing proposals to restore production and livelihoods[151][152][154]. USAID is providing market-based assistance and supporting logistical operations, including repairing homes and addressing water and sanitation needs[161][162]. The Jamaica Public Service (JPS) and the National Water Commission (NWC) are working to restore utility services in affected communities[156].\n\nInitially, 1,876 people, including elderly and children, were accommodated in 275 shelters, with 108 shelters later deactivated[176][177]. Many families are in need of clean water, food, and reconstruction supplies, as well as psychological support[178]. State-run infirmaries offer shelter and support services to vulnerable individuals, and the National Arena has been opened to accommodate residents[184][188]. A joint UN mission observed the need for water, food, and reconstruction supplies during their visit to affected areas[196].",

Seprod and Musson Foundations have committed to donating 2 million to this fund[2]. The UWJ is calling on private and public organizations to collaborate in strengthening efforts to provide effective assistance through the FRF initiative, which will facilitate access to critical resources such as seeds, equipment, and financial aid to help farmers restore their livelihoods[3].\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is utilizing its Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA) to mobilize technical assistance and support its coordination and response capacities in affected countries[14][15]. This includes deploying staff, conducting field missions, and engaging in logistics, partnerships, resource mobilization, and technical assistance activities[14][15]. FAO has been active in the Caribbean areas affected by Hurricane Beryl, conducting rapid needs assessments and preparing proposals to restore production and livelihoods[11]. They are using drones and satellite remote sensing for damage and needs assessment, complemented by ground-level data collection through surveys and interviews to guide response and recovery planning[11]. The damage to agriculture in Jamaica includes losses in crops, livestock, and fishing capacity, with preliminary assessments indicating significant impacts[11]. FAO is collaborating with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA) on a response plan that highlights the needs of producers and fishermen[12]. Mario Lubetkin, FAO Assistant Director-General, has reiterated FAO's commitment to supporting Caribbean countries in mobilizing international cooperation for recovery efforts[14][15].\n\nThe estimated financial damages to Jamaica's agricultural sector due to Hurricane Beryl exceed US$6.4 million, raising concerns about food security and the livelihoods of small producers[24][21]. The devastation has led to crop and infrastructure damage, livestock losses, soil erosion, and economic challenges for farmers, affecting food access for families and communities and impacting the entire agricultural supply chain in Jamaica[22][29].\n\nThe REACH (Relief Emergency Assistance and Community Help) programme is structured to ensure the equitable distribution of food and essential supplies through a transparent and non-partisan process[51]. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security has been distributing care packages containing enough food for a family of four for four days[51]. An initial allocation of $5 million was provided for welfare activities, including food distribution, with an additional $4 million allocated to all 63 constituencies to assist in recovery efforts[55][52]. The criteria for resource allocation involve a transparent assessment process conducted by the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) and other entities, focusing on areas with the greatest damage, such as Rocky Point and Portland Cottage[57][55].\n\nThe government is working with non-government organizations like Food For The Poor and Red Cross to conduct timely assessments and provide support[71]. Relief efforts are also focused on areas like Gimme-Me-Bit, Race Course, and regions in South West Clarendon and along the south coast[71]. The Prime Minister has emphasized the need for a transparent process to ensure that aid reaches the truly needy, avoiding favoritism[32]. This process is supported by assessments from ODPEM and other agencies, ensuring that assistance is directed to the most affected communities[35].\n\nIn response to the widespread damage, the Government of Jamaica has declared the country a disaster area and accepted support from the United Nations[95][98]. The UN Resident Coordinator activated the United Nations Emergency Technical Team (UNETT) and reassured the government of the UN's readiness to support[96]. Rapid needs assessments have been initiated by ODPEM and other agencies, with UNICEF participating in joint assessments[98]. Humanitarian teams, including those from OCHA and UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC), are working with authorities to complete assessments and deliver assistance[100]. The UN has allocated US$4 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support humanitarian operations in Grenada, Jamaica, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines[99]. UNICEF is collaborating with other agencies to prepare a joint appeal for Jamaica to support the response[91].\n\nA joint UN mission, including UNICEF, the World Food Programme (WFP), and OCHA, observed the urgent needs of families for water, food, cleaning, and reconstruction supplies, as well as psychological support, during their visit to affected areas such as Old Harbor Bay, Portland Cottage, Rocky Point, Alligator Pond, and Treasure Beach[106].",

            "cluster_summary": "The aftermath of Hurricane Beryl has left significant challenges in its wake, particularly affecting children and their caregivers due to the increased risk of water and vector-borne diseases caused by rains and flooding[1]. To address these health risks, UNICEF is prepared to provide essential supplies such as repellent-impregnated mosquito nets and water purification supplies[1][3]. Additionally, UNICEF plans to distribute WASH dignity kits, cleaning kits, 10-liter water containers for proper water carrying and storage, and hand-washing stations in shelters to support affected families[7]. Hygiene promotion remains a critical humanitarian need[2], and UNICEF has prepositioned technical assistance along with water, hygiene, and dignity supplies for vulnerable children and adolescents[10].\n\nThe parishes of St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, Manchester, Westmoreland, and Hanover were among the most severely impacted by the storm, which caused extensive damage to infrastructure, including water, electricity, and health facilities[11]. Across the island, utility poles and powerlines were downed, and there was significant wind damage to infrastructure and roofing, as well as flooding and storm surges[13][16]. Authorities are actively working to restore essential services such as telecommunications, electricity, road access, and water supply[16].\n\nUNICEF participated in joint assessments organized by the Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) on July 8th and 10th to evaluate the affected areas[21]. A report from July 10 to 13, 2024, highlighted the storm's impact on shelters, infrastructure, agriculture, and livelihoods, including fishing[30]. The most affected parishes were St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, Manchester, Westmoreland, and Hanover, with other areas also reporting damage[30].\n\nInitially, 1,876 people, including 113 children, were sheltered in 275 facilities[36]. Over 1,800 individuals were accommodated in 156 of these shelters, while ODPEM de-activated 108 shelters[37]. As of a later report, 10 shelters remain open, with some housing more than 100 people[33]. Many families are in urgent need of clean water, food, and reconstruction supplies for their homes, as well as psychological support[38]. Essential relief items include clean-up kits, hygiene kits, and tarps[34], with ongoing water and sanitation needs[31].\n\nState-run infirmaries across the island provide shelter and support services to the elderly, destitute, and mentally challenged individuals[48]. Residents of the St Ann Infirmary are currently occupying a school[48]. Field visits have confirmed the need for clean water, food, and reconstruction supplies, along with psychological support for many families[44]. The National Arena, facilitated by the Red Cross, has been opened to accommodate residents[44].\n\nA joint UN mission, including UNICEF, the World Food Programme (WFP), and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), observed the dire needs of families for water, food, cleaning, and reconstruction supplies, as well as psychological support during their visit to Old Harbor Bay, Portland Cottage, Rocky Point, Alligator Pond, and Treasure Beach on July 6[56].",

To mitigate these risks, UNICEF is prepared to provide essential supplies for disease prevention, including repellent-impregnated mosquito nets and water purification supplies[1][3]. Additionally, UNICEF plans to deliver WASH dignity kits, cleaning kits, 10-liter water containers for proper water carrying and storage, and hand-washing stations in shelters to affected families[7]. Hygiene promotion is identified as a priority humanitarian need, and UNICEF has prepositioned technical assistance, water, hygiene, and dignity supplies for vulnerable children and adolescents[2][10].\n\nDespite these efforts, ongoing rains and debris are obstructing access and delaying aid delivery and assessments, particularly in rural areas[11]. Humanitarian access is further challenged by flooding, debris from fallen trees, landslides, and infrastructural damage[16]. However, the sources do not specify the measures being taken to address these obstructions and delays. In response, partners are providing technical assistance for assessments and analysis to support the Government-led response[22].\n\nUNICEF participated in two joint assessments organized by the Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) on July 8th and 10th to the affected areas[31]. A report covering the period from July 10 to 13, 2024, indicated that the storm caused significant damage to shelters, infrastructure including water, electricity, and health infrastructure, as well as agriculture and other livelihoods such as fishing[40]. The most affected parishes were St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, Manchester, Westmoreland, and Hanover, with impacts also reported in other parishes[40].\n\nInitially, 1,876 people, including elderly and 113 children, were in 275 shelters[46]. Over 1,800 people were accommodated in 156 of the 275 activated shelters, and the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) de-activated 108 shelters[47]. As of a later report, 10 shelters remain open with more than 100 people occupying some of them[43].\n\nMany families are in need of access to clean water, food, and reconstruction supplies for their homes, as well as psychological support[48].

Before the hurricane even arrived, smaller, portable power supply products were quickly \"snatched up\" by customers[1]. To address this challenge and ensure an adequate supply during the hurricane season, ATL has taken several strategic measures. They have ordered additional generators to cover the five-month hurricane season, with plans to have more than one container of generators arrive and be dispatched to various locations well in advance[12]. This preparation anticipates potential changes in weather patterns and the possibility of an earlier hurricane season next year[12].\n\nATL is committed to maintaining stable prices during this period. Despite the expectation that new generator stock from suppliers in China will take about two months to reach Jamaica and will likely be priced higher due to increased demand and currency fluctuations, ATL's Crichton has assured the public that prices will not be raised during the hurricane season[21]. This commitment is part of ATL's broader strategy to protect customers, similar to their approach with air conditioning units, where they put products on sale when demand is high without increasing prices above normal rates[11][14][21][24].\n\nHowever, the current availability of generators is limited. On a recent Monday, only 10 units were sold, followed by 11 on Tuesday, indicating a high demand across all three ATL branches[21]. While more generators have been ordered to meet this demand, it may still be challenging to supply everyone's needs[22]. Nonetheless, ATL remains focused on ensuring that their customers have access to necessary power supplies without facing price hikes during critical times[21][22].",

            "cluster_summary": "The United Way of Jamaica (UWJ) has launched a Farmer's Rehabilitation Fund (FRF) with the goal of raising up to 20 million to support farming communities affected by Hurricane Beryl, particularly in the parishes of Clarendon, St Elizabeth, and Manchester, which were severely impacted by the storm[1]. The FRF aims to mobilize resources and provide financial support to these farmers, facilitating access to critical resources such as seeds, equipment, and financial aid to help restore their livelihoods[1][3]. Seprod and Musson Foundations have committed to donating 2 million to this rehabilitation fund[2]. The UWJ is calling on private and public organizations to collaborate in strengthening efforts to provide effective assistance through the FRF initiative[3].\n\nHurricane Beryl caused significant damage to Jamaica's agricultural sector, with authorities estimating over US$6.4 million in damages across affected countries[14]. The devastation has severely impacted agriculture, threatening food security and the livelihoods of small producers[11]. Damaged crops include vegetables and fruits, essential food sources on the island, and the livestock and fisheries sectors have also suffered considerable damage, including loss of fishing capacity and damage to vessels and equipment[11][14]. This has led to crop and infrastructure damage, livestock losses, soil erosion, and economic challenges for farmers, raising concerns about food security and affecting citizens' access to food[12][14][19].\n\nIn response, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security is committed to ensuring no one is left behind, urging all Jamaicans, especially those in a better position, to assist in rebuilding the nation by volunteering, donating supplies, and offering skills and expertise[21][22]. The Ministry collaborates with other ministries and NGOs like the Red Cross and Food for the Poor to deliver immediate relief supplies and conduct damage assessments[22]. They have provided hygiene kits and water, and are working with community leaders and Members of Parliament to address the needs of affected individuals, acknowledging the frustration and concerns of vulnerable populations[24].\n\nThe Government of Jamaica has declared the country a disaster area under the Disaster Risk Management Enforcement Measures Order 2024, focusing on recovery efforts[35][38]. The United Nations (UN) has offered support, with the UN Resident Coordinator activating the United Nations Emergency Technical Team (UNETT) and reassuring the government of the UN's readiness to assist[36][38]. The Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) and other agencies have begun rapid needs assessments, with UNICEF participating in joint assessments[38]. Humanitarian teams, including those from OCHA and UNDAC, are working with authorities to complete assessments and deliver assistance[40]. The UN has allocated US$4 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support operations in Jamaica and other affected regions[39]. UNICEF is collaborating with other agencies to prepare a joint appeal for Jamaica to support the response[31].\n\nIn the wake of the hurricane, the demand for generators has increased, with new stock from China expected to take two months to arrive, and prices anticipated to rise due to demand and currency fluctuations[41]. However, ATL's Crichton assured that prices would not increase during the hurricane season, and generators might be put on sale when demand is high[41][44]. Despite limited stock, more generators have been ordered to meet the high demand[42].\n\nUSAID is also playing a crucial role by providing market-based assistance to help residents purchase basic commodities and supporting logistical operations[51][52]. They plan to partner in repairing homes, addressing water and sanitation needs, and providing essential relief items such as clean-up kits, hygiene kits, and tarps[51]. USAID has disaster experts on the ground in Jamaica, actively supporting damage assessments and coordination efforts[52].",

            "cluster_summary": "Ongoing rains and debris are significantly obstructing access in Jamaica, delaying aid delivery and assessments, particularly in rural areas where access remains a challenge due to flooding, debris from fallen trees, landslides, and infrastructural damage[1][7][11][16][21]. To address these issues, recovery efforts include \"debushing and the carting away of debris\" and \"cleaning and desilting of drains\"[6]. The chief of defence staff has been instructed to mobilize the Disaster Assistance and Recovery Team and other supporting units, including engineers, to assist with rebuilding and recovery in areas with the greatest damage, such as Rocky Point and Portland Cottage[2]. Social workers are conducting daily assessments and providing support, including mattresses, food packages, and tarpaulins, to impacted residents[6].\n\nCommunication challenges are exacerbating the situation, particularly in Clarendon and some areas of St Elizabeth, where communication is completely down, preventing officers from communicating on either telecommunication provider[31]. The lack of communication and coverage from partners has hampered government work, as telecommunications providers Digicel and Flow were dependent on JPS Jamaica Public Service for electricity[34]. Most of St Elizabeth is without power, and power must be restored first for Digicel and Flow to provide connectivity to customers[38]. To overcome these communication barriers, teams are going house to house to promptly deploy islandwide, deliver immediate relief supplies, and conduct initial damage assessments[31]. Efforts are being made by Digicel Jamaica to restore connectivity in St Elizabeth[32]. The government is speaking with telecommunications providers Digicel and Flow regarding coverage[34]. There is an effort to get across the network and utilize as many community leaders as possible to work with Members of Parliament[33].\n\nHurricane Beryl caused extensive damage to utility poles and downed powerlines across parishes in Jamaica[52][53][54]. Other significantly affected infrastructure includes telecommunications, electricity, road, water, and roofing[53]. The storm also caused significant damage to shelters, health infrastructure, and housing[51]. Additionally, agriculture and other livelihoods such as fishing were impacted[51]. Current priorities for restoration involve authorities steadily working to restore services such as telecommunications, electricity, road, and water, aiming to restore a semblance of normality to communities[54][60]. The parishes of St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, Manchester, Westmoreland, and Hanover were reported to be among the most affected following Hurricane Beryl[61]. Across the island, there was extensive damage to utility poles and downed powerlines, along with wind damage to infrastructure and roofing, flooding, and storm surges[63][66].\n\nAppliance Traders Ltd (ATL) is addressing the increased demand for power generators by having more units \"on the way\"[81]. The challenge they faced was that the smaller, portable power supply products were \"snatched up\" before Hurricane Beryl even arrived[81]. ATL is taking several measures to ensure an adequate supply of generators in Jamaica during the hurricane season, including ordering more generators and planning to adjust by having more than one container of generators arrive in stock and be dispatched to various locations well ahead of time[92]. They assure the public that they will not increase prices during the hurricane season to protect their customers[91][94].\n\nTo address the significant damage to livelihood infrastructure in the southern region of Jamaica following Hurricane Beryl, several measures are being implemented. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is deployed in affected areas of the Caribbean, including Jamaica, to advance rapid needs assessment and prepare proposals to restore production and livelihoods[111][112][114]. USAID also has disaster experts on the ground in Jamaica actively supporting damage assessments and coordination efforts[118]. Families in southern coastal areas, including Clarendon, Manchester, and St. Elizabeth, are in need of access to clean water, food, and reconstruction supplies for their homes, as well as psychological support[116][117]. In St Elizabeth, the Jamaica Public Service (JPS) Foundation and Food For The Poor (FFTP) Jamaica are providing care packages and access to charging stations[113]. Support to social protection systems is being implemented, including potential provision of food assistance to affected populations through existing government systems and modalities, and direct World Food Programme (WFP) assistance as required, utilizing cash-based transfers (CBT) and/or vouchers[114]. Investments in CBT assistance are expected to be complemented by a top-up of Jamaica's Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) policy, which, if triggered, will direct a fixed percentage of a potential CCRIF payout towards providing cash transfers to impacted people via the country's social protection system[120].\n\nThe Jamaican government is prioritizing the fast-tracking of repairs to markets damaged by Hurricane Beryl[121]. The Falmouth, Mandeville, Lucea, and Old Harbour markets, located in Trelawny, Manchester, Hanover, and St Catherine respectively, were significantly impacted by the hurricane's gale-force winds and torrential rains[121]. Earlier in the year, the Government had announced a 500-million programme for markets across the country[121].",

The government coordinates the distribution of food, water, medical sundries, and other essentials, ensuring that these resources reach citizens in the hardest-hit areas [1][11]. To maintain fairness, the Prime Minister emphasized the need for a transparent process to identify \"the needy beneficiary and not the greedy person,\" integrating past experiences and technology to prevent favoritism [2]. This non-partisan approach involves all members of parliament, highlighting that \"there is no colour or affiliation in a disaster\" [5].\n\nThe Ministry of Labour and Social Security plays a crucial role in this effort, distributing care packages that provide enough food for a family of four for four days [11]. An initial allocation of $5 million was designated for welfare activities, including food distribution, with an additional $4 million allocated to all 63 constituencies to aid recovery efforts [12][15]. The criteria for resource allocation involve a transparent assessment process conducted by the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM), utilities, and public infrastructure [17][18]. This process identifies areas categorized as \"severely impacted,\" directing support to communities like Rocky Point and Portland Cottage, where damage is extensive [15][17].\n\nThe Ministry of Labour and Social Security is committed to ensuring no one is left behind, urging all Jamaicans, especially those in better positions, to contribute to rebuilding efforts by volunteering and donating supplies [21]. The Ministry collaborates with other ministries and NGOs, such as the Red Cross and Food for the Poor, to deliver immediate relief supplies and conduct damage assessments [22]. They have provided 612 hygiene kits and 159 cases of water, working with community leaders and Members of Parliament to address the needs of affected individuals [24]. The Ministry acknowledges the challenges faced by children and seniors, particularly concerning their medicines and accommodations [24].\n\nIn response to the increased demand for generators following Hurricane Beryl, new stock from China is expected to arrive in approximately two months, with prices anticipated to rise due to demand and currency fluctuations [31]. However, ATL's Crichton assured that prices would not increase during the hurricane season, and generators might be put on sale when demand is high [31][34]. Despite limited stock, with only 10 units sold on Monday and 11 on Tuesday, more generators have been ordered to meet the needs of all three branches [31][32].\n\nState-run infirmaries across the island provide shelter and support services to the elderly, destitute, and mentally challenged individuals [48]. In St Ann, residents of the infirmary are currently housed in a school [48]. Field visits have revealed that many families require access to clean water, food, reconstruction supplies, and psychological support [44]. The National Arena, facilitated by the Red Cross, has been opened to accommodate residents in need [44].",

            "cluster_summary": "Ongoing rains and debris in Jamaica are severely obstructing access, delaying aid delivery and assessments[1]. Humanitarian access is further challenged by flooding, debris from fallen trees, landslides, and infrastructural damage[7]. To address these issues, recovery efforts include \"debushing and the carting away of debris\" and \"cleaning and desilting of drains\"[6]. The chief of defence staff has been instructed to mobilize the Disaster Assistance and Recovery Team and other supporting units, including engineers, to assist with rebuilding and recovery in areas with the greatest damage, such as Rocky Point and Portland Cottage[2]. Social workers are conducting daily assessments and providing support, including mattresses, food packages, and tarpaulins, to impacted residents[6]. Partners are providing technical assistance for assessments and analysis to support the Government-led response[12].\n\nSevere damage in Saint Elizabeth, Clarendon, and Manchester requires emergency shelter materials and relocation assistance for those displaced[21]. However, the specific emergency shelter materials or types of relocation assistance being prioritized are not detailed. An additional 4 million allocated for roofing replacement will focus largely on helping individuals replace their roofing[31]. To ensure accountability, Members of Parliament were cautioned that \"everyone who receives a benefit must sign for it\"[31].\n\nCommunication with affected areas in Clarendon and some areas of St Elizabeth is challenging due to a complete communication breakdown, preventing officers from communicating on either telecommunication provider[41]. Telecommunication service remains a challenge in St Elizabeth[42]. The lack of communication and coverage from partners has hampered government work, as telecommunications providers Digicel and Flow were dependent on JPS Jamaica Public Service for electricity[44]. Most of St Elizabeth is without power, and power must be restored first for Digicel and Flow to provide connectivity to customers[48]. This difficulty in communication is why some people are not hearing from teams[43]. To overcome these barriers, teams are going house to house to promptly deploy islandwide, deliver immediate relief supplies, and conduct initial damage assessments[41]. Efforts are being made by Digicel Jamaica to restore connectivity in St Elizabeth[42]. The government is speaking with telecommunications providers Digicel and Flow regarding coverage[44]. There is an effort to get across the network and utilize as many community leaders as possible to work with Members of Parliament[43]. Restoring power is a crucial step for Digicel and Flow to be able to provide connectivity[48]. The government will also need to consider greater use of technology[44].\n\nHurricane Beryl caused extensive damage to utility poles and downed powerlines across parishes in Jamaica[62][63][64]. Other significantly affected infrastructure includes telecommunications, electricity, road, water, and roofing[63]. The storm also caused significant damage to shelters, health infrastructure, and housing[61]. Additionally, agriculture and other livelihoods such as fishing were impacted[61]. Current priorities for restoration involve authorities steadily working to restore services such as telecommunications, electricity, road, and water[64], aiming to restore a semblance of normality to communities[64]. Authorities are also working to finish restoring basic services, including water, power, and health services[70].\n\nThe parishes of St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, Manchester, Westmoreland, and Hanover were reported to be among the most affected following Hurricane Beryl[71]. The storm caused significant damage to infrastructure in these areas, including water, electricity, and health infrastructure[71]. Across the island, there was extensive damage to utility poles and downed powerlines[76], along with wind damage to infrastructure and roofing, flooding, and storm surges[73]. Authorities are working to restore services such as telecommunications, electricity, road, and water[76], and generally to finish restoring basic services[76].\n\nNew generator stock from suppliers in China is expected to take approximately two months to reach Jamaica and will not have the same price as pre-Hurricane Beryl, with prices anticipated to \"definitely increase\" due to variables such as demand and the dollar[91]. However, ATL's Crichton assured the public that ATL will not increase any prices during the hurricane season to protect customers[91]. Another source also stated that prices would not increase above what they would have normally been priced at, and that generators might be put on sale when demand is greater, similar to air conditioning units[94]. Due to high demand from all three branches, it may not be possible to supply everyone's needs[92], although more generators have been ordered[92].\n\nTo address the significant damage to livelihood infrastructure in the southern region of Jamaica following Hurricane Beryl, several measures are being implemented. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is deployed in affected areas of the Caribbean, including Jamaica, to advance rapid needs assessment and prepare proposals to restore production and livelihoods[121][122][124]. This includes damage and needs assessment using drones and satellite remote sensing, along with ground-level data collection through surveys and key informant interviews, all of which will guide response and recovery planning[121][122][124]. USAID also has disaster experts on the ground in Jamaica actively supporting damage assessments and coordination efforts[128]. Families in southern coastal areas, including Clarendon, Manchester, and St. Elizabeth, are in need of access to clean water, food, and reconstruction supplies for their homes, as well as psychological support[126][127]. In St Elizabeth, the Jamaica Public Service (JPS) Foundation and Food For The Poor (FFTP) Jamaica are providing care packages and access to charging stations[123]. Support to social protection systems is being implemented, including potential provision of food assistance to affected populations through existing government systems and modalities, and direct World Food Programme (WFP) assistance as required, utilizing cash-based transfers (CBT) and/or vouchers[124]. Investments in CBT assistance are expected to be complemented by a top-up of Jamaica's Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) policy, which, if triggered, will direct a fixed percentage of a potential CCRIF payout towards providing cash transfers to impacted people via the country's social protection system[130].\n\nThe Jamaican government is prioritizing the fast-tracking of repairs to markets damaged by Hurricane Beryl[131]. The Falmouth, Mandeville, Lucea, and Old Harbour markets, located in Trelawny, Manchester, Hanover, and St Catherine respectively, were significantly impacted by the hurricane's gale-force winds and torrential rains[131]. Earlier in the year, the Government had announced a 500-million programme for markets across the country[131].\n\nInitially, 1876 people, including elderly and 113 children, were in 275 shelters[146]. Over 1,800 people were accommodated in 156 of the 275 activated shelters[147]. The Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) de-activated 108 shelters[147]. As of a later report, 10 shelters remain open with more than 100 people occupying some of them[143]. Many families are in need of access to clean water, food, and reconstruction supplies for their homes, as well as psychological support[148]. Essential relief items include clean-up kits, hygiene kits, and tarps[144]. Water and sanitation needs are also present[141].",

            "cluster_summary": "The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is actively utilizing its Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA) to provide technical assistance and bolster its coordination and response capacities in countries affected by disasters, such as those impacted by Hurricane Beryl[4][5]. This initiative includes the rapid deployment of staff, field missions, logistics, partnerships, resource mobilization, and technical assistance activities[4][5]. In response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Beryl, which severely affected agriculture and threatened food security and livelihoods in the Caribbean, FAO has taken decisive actions[1]. They have deployed teams to the affected areas to conduct rapid needs assessments and prepare proposals aimed at restoring production and livelihoods[1]. Utilizing drones and satellite remote sensing, FAO supports damage and needs assessments, complemented by ground-level data collection through surveys and key informant interviews, to guide response and recovery planning[1].\n\nIn Jamaica, the hurricane inflicted significant damage on agriculture, with preliminary assessments indicating that several crops, including vegetables and fruits, were affected[1][14]. The storm also caused extensive damage to fishing capacity, including vessels, support infrastructure, and fishing equipment, as well as livestock[1][11][14]. The overall devastation has led to crop and infrastructure damage, livestock losses, soil erosion, and economic challenges for farmers, raising concerns about food security and livelihoods[12][14][19]. The estimated financial damage to Jamaica's agricultural sector exceeds US$6.4 million (JMD1 billion)[14][61].\n\nThe FAO is collaborating with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA) to develop a response plan that addresses the identified needs of producers and fishermen[2]. Mario Lubetkin, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Latin America and the Caribbean, has reiterated FAO's commitment to supporting Caribbean countries by mobilizing international cooperation for the recovery of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries production[4][5].\n\nThe ongoing rains and debris in Jamaica are obstructing access, delaying aid delivery and assessments, and posing challenges to humanitarian access due to flooding, debris from fallen trees, landslides, and infrastructural damage[21][27][41][46]. Recovery efforts include \"debushing and the carting away of debris\" and \"cleaning and desilting of drains\"[26]. The chief of defence staff has mobilized the Disaster Assistance and Recovery Team and other supporting units, including engineers, to assist with rebuilding and recovery in the hardest-hit areas, such as Rocky Point and Portland Cottage[22]. Social workers are conducting daily assessments and providing support, including mattresses, food packages, and tarpaulins, to impacted residents[26].\n\nThe risk of water and vector-borne diseases is heightened due to rains and flooding, affecting children and their caregivers[31]. To mitigate this risk, UNICEF is prepared to provide essential supplies for disease prevention, including repellent-impregnated mosquito nets and water purification supplies[31][33]. UNICEF also plans to deliver WASH dignity kits and cleaning kits to affected families, along with 10-liter water containers for proper water carrying and storage, and hand-washing stations in shelters[37]. Hygiene promotion is a priority humanitarian need, and UNICEF has prepositioned technical assistance, water, hygiene, and dignity supplies for delivery to vulnerable children and adolescents[32][40].\n\nThe Government of Jamaica has formally acknowledged and accepted support from the United Nations (UN), allowing UN agencies to assist vulnerable populations[121]. The UN Resident Coordinator (RC) activated the United Nations Emergency Technical Team (UNETT) and reassured the Government of Jamaica of the UN's readiness to support[96][121]. The UN allocated US$4 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support humanitarian operations in Grenada, Jamaica, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines[99][125]. UNICEF participated in joint assessments organized by the Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) on July 8th and 10th, and continues to work with other agencies under the leadership of the UN RC/HC to prepare a joint appeal for Jamaica to support the response[98][101][123].\n\nIn response to the increased demand for power generators, Appliance Traders Ltd (ATL) is ensuring an adequate supply by ordering more units for the hurricane season, which is expected to last five months[131][142]. ATL has committed not to increase prices during the hurricane season, applying the same principle as for air conditioning units, by putting generators on sale when demand is greater without raising prices above normal rates[141][144].\n\nThe Ministry of Labour and Social Security, along with other government ministries and NGOs such as the Red Cross and Food for the Poor, is actively involved in relief efforts, conducting house-to-house visits to deliver immediate relief supplies and conduct initial damage assessments[71][72]. Jamaicans are encouraged to volunteer and donate supplies, with community members assisting in managing shelters and repairing damaged roofs[73][74][79].\n\nHurricane Beryl caused extensive damage to utility poles, downed powerlines, and significantly affected infrastructure, including telecommunications, electricity, roads, water, and roofing across parishes in Jamaica[82][83][84]. The storm also damaged shelters, health infrastructure, and housing, impacting agriculture and other livelihoods such as fishing[81][92]. Restoration efforts are focused on steadily working to restore services such as telecommunications, electricity, road, and water, aiming to bring normality back to communities[84][90].\n\nThe Government of Jamaica has declared the country a disaster area under the Disaster Risk Management Enforcement Measures Order 2024, with a focus on recovery[95][98]. The UN Resident Coordinator activated the United Nations Emergency Technical Team (UNETT) to support the joint UN response, and humanitarians, including teams from OCHA and UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC), continue to work with authorities to complete assessments and deliver assistance in affected areas[100][121][127].",

The FRF aims to mobilize resources and provide financial support to these farmers, facilitating access to critical resources such as seeds, equipment, and financial aid to help restore their livelihoods[1][3]. Seprod and Musson Foundations have committed to donating 2 million to this rehabilitation fund, and the UWJ is urging private and public organizations to collaborate to strengthen its efforts through the FRF initiative[2][3].\n\nIn response to the widespread damage caused by Hurricane Beryl, which has severely affected agriculture and threatened food security and livelihoods, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is actively engaged in the Caribbean, including Jamaica, to conduct rapid needs assessments and prepare proposals to restore production and livelihoods[11]. FAO is utilizing its Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA) to mobilize technical assistance and support its coordination and response capacities in affected countries[14][15]. This includes deploying staff, conducting field missions, and using drones and satellite remote sensing for damage and needs assessment, which will guide response and recovery planning[11][14][15]. The FAO is also collaborating with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA) on a response plan that highlights the needs of producers and fishermen[12]. Mario Lubetkin, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Latin America and the Caribbean, has reiterated FAO's commitment to mobilizing international cooperation for the recovery of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries production in the affected regions[14][15].\n\nThe ongoing rains and debris in Jamaica are obstructing access, delaying aid delivery and assessments, and posing challenges to humanitarian access due to flooding, debris from fallen trees, landslides, and infrastructural damage[21][27][31][36]. Recovery efforts are underway, including \"debushing and the carting away of debris\" and \"cleaning and desilting of drains\"[26]. The chief of defence staff has been instructed to mobilize the Disaster Assistance and Recovery Team and other supporting units, including engineers, to assist with rebuilding and recovery in the hardest-hit areas, such as Rocky Point and Portland Cottage[22]. Social workers are conducting daily assessments and providing support, including mattresses, food packages, and tarpaulins, to impacted residents[26].\n\nThe government estimates that the agricultural sector in Jamaica has suffered damage exceeding US$6.4 million (JMD1 billion), raising concerns about food security and livelihoods[41]. The most affected parishes include St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, Manchester, Westmoreland, and Hanover, with impacts also reported in other areas[52]. In response, the Government of Jamaica has announced a focus on recovery, with the Prime Minister issuing the Disaster Risk Management Enforcement Measures Order 2024, declaring Jamaica a disaster area[55][58]. The government has accepted support from the United Nations, with the UN Resident Coordinator activating the United Nations Emergency Technical Team (UNETT) and reassuring the Government of Jamaica of the UN's readiness to assist[56][58]. The Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) and other government agencies have started rapid needs assessments, with UNICEF participating in joint assessments organized by ODPEM[58]. Humanitarian teams, including those from OCHA and UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC), continue to work with authorities to complete assessments and deliver assistance in affected areas[60]. The UN has allocated US$4 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support humanitarian operations in Grenada, Jamaica, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and UNICEF is working with other agencies to prepare a joint appeal for Jamaica to support the response[51][59].",

This activation is part of a broader effort to address the significant challenges faced by the country, particularly in the most affected parishes of St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, Manchester, Westmoreland, and Hanover, where the storm caused extensive damage to shelters, infrastructure, agriculture, and other livelihoods[60]. The Government of Jamaica has formally accepted the UN's offer of support, allowing UN agencies to assist vulnerable populations[71].\n\nCommunication issues have severely hampered relief efforts, especially in Clarendon and St. Elizabeth, where telecommunication services are down, preventing effective communication[21][22]. This disruption is largely due to the dependency of telecommunications providers Digicel and Flow on the Jamaica Public Service (JPS) for electricity, which is currently unavailable in most of St. Elizabeth[24][28]. To mitigate these challenges, teams are conducting house-to-house visits to deliver immediate relief supplies and perform initial damage assessments[21][33]. Efforts are underway to restore connectivity, with Digicel Jamaica actively working to reestablish services in St. Elizabeth[22][34].\n\nThe Ministry of Labour and Social Security is spearheading efforts to ensure no one is left behind, urging all Jamaicans to contribute to the rebuilding process by volunteering and donating supplies[41][42]. The Ministry, alongside other governmental and non-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross and Food for the Poor, is actively involved in relief operations, providing hygiene kits, water, and other essential supplies[42][44]. Community leaders are being mobilized to work with Members of Parliament to enhance the coordination of these efforts[44].\n\nUNICEF has been actively participating in joint assessments organized by the Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) and is collaborating with other agencies under the UN Resident Coordinator's leadership to prepare a joint appeal for Jamaica[51][71][73]. The UN has allocated US$4 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support humanitarian operations in Jamaica and other affected regions[75]. Humanitarian teams, including those from OCHA and UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC), continue to work with Jamaican authorities to complete assessments and deliver assistance[77].\n\nState-run infirmaries are providing shelter and support services to vulnerable populations, including the elderly and mentally challenged individuals, with some residents temporarily housed in schools[98]. The National Arena has been opened to accommodate displaced residents, facilitated by the Red Cross[94]. Field visits have highlighted the urgent need for clean water, food, reconstruction supplies, and psychological support for affected families[94].\n\nIn summary, the coordinated efforts of the Jamaican government, UN agencies, and various humanitarian organizations are focused on overcoming logistical challenges, restoring essential services, and providing comprehensive support to the affected communities. The collaboration between local and international partners is crucial in addressing the immediate needs and facilitating the long-term recovery of the nation.",

To address this, UNICEF is prepared to provide essential supplies for disease prevention, including repellent-impregnated mosquito nets and water purification supplies, as well as WASH dignity kits and cleaning kits for affected families. Additionally, UNICEF will supply 10-liter water containers for proper water carrying and storage, and establish hand-washing stations in shelters, emphasizing hygiene promotion as a priority humanitarian need. UNICEF has also prepositioned technical assistance, water, hygiene, and dignity supplies for delivery to vulnerable children and adolescents [1][2][3][7][10].\n\nIn Jamaica, partners are collaborating to provide technical assistance for assessments and analysis to bolster the Government-led response. The Resident Coordinator's Office (RCO) has activated the United Nations Emergency Technical Team (UNETT) and offered the UN's support to the Government of Jamaica through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade [12][21]. The Ministry is working with non-government organizations such as Food For The Poor and Red Cross to conduct assessments and provide support promptly. Relief efforts are focused on areas like Gimme-Me-Bit, Race Course, and regions in South West Clarendon and along the south coast [31].\n\nThe Ministry of Labour and Social Security is committed to inclusivity, urging all Jamaicans, especially those in better positions, to contribute to rebuilding efforts. Teams from various ministries, including local government, community development, education and youth, and health and wellness, along with NGOs like Red Cross and Food for the Poor, are collaborating with the Labour Ministry. These teams are conducting house-to-house visits to deliver immediate relief supplies and perform initial damage assessments. The relief outreach is supported by several NGOs, partners, and volunteers, with community members assisting in managing shelters and repairing damaged roofs [41][42][43][44][49].\n\nUNICEF participated in joint assessments organized by the Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) on July 8th and 10th in affected areas. A report from July 10 to 13, 2024, highlighted significant damage to shelters, infrastructure, agriculture, and other livelihoods, with the most affected parishes being St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, Manchester, Westmoreland, and Hanover [51][60]. The Government of Jamaica has formally accepted the UN's support, allowing agencies to assist vulnerable populations [71].\n\nSpecific coordination efforts include a briefing on July 9 by Minister Dana Morris Dixon to the International Development Partners Group, chaired by the UN Resident Coordinator, on the situation and relief efforts. The RC activated UNETT, co-chaired by UNICEF and WFP, to support the joint UN response. UNICEF is also collaborating with other agencies under the UN RCHC's leadership to prepare a joint appeal for Jamaica. The UN allocated US$4 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support operations in Grenada, Jamaica, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Humanitarian teams, including OCHA and UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC), continue to work with Jamaican authorities to complete assessments and deliver assistance [71][72][73][75][77].\n\nAgency partners and stakeholders have been asked to update their readiness for the hurricane season. Observations indicate a need for businesses to adjust stock levels, particularly for generators, as hurricanes are developing earlier in the season, aligning with climate change predictions. This suggests a need for increased preparedness and stock dispatch well in advance [81][82][83]. Representatives from agencies, including the Jamaica Constabulary Force and Jamaica Red Cross, attend meetings to provide readiness updates [91].\n\nUSAID plans to provide market-based assistance to help residents purchase basic commodities and support logistical operations. They also intend to partner in repairing homes, addressing water and sanitation needs, and providing essential relief items like clean-up kits, hygiene kits, and tarps. USAID has disaster experts on the ground in Jamaica, actively supporting damage assessments and coordination efforts [101][102].",
