    "summary": "Indonesia is currently experiencing multiple natural disasters, primarily severe flash floods and cold lava flows from Mount Marapi in West Sumatra, which began on May 11[12]. The death toll from these events has risen to 67, with 20 people still missing, and earlier reports indicated 57 victims found dead and 22 missing[23]. These disasters have affected at least six regencies and cities, including Agam and Tanah Datar, destroying hundreds of homes and damaging public infrastructure[7]. President Joko Widodo has directed authorities to accelerate the rebuilding of damaged infrastructure, while rescue operations involve thermal drones, excavators, and manual searching for survivors[21]. Weather modification technology is being deployed to reduce rainfall intensity, and a state of emergency is in effect until May 26[11]. Concurrently, Mount Ibu in North Maluku Province has seen a series of eruptions since April, with a significant eruption on May 27 spewing ash 6km high, prompting the evacuation of residents from seven nearby villages and over 12,000 people from a nearby island[20][21][22]. The volcano's alert level has been elevated to IV, and aviation warnings have been issued[21]. Additionally, earlier in May, flooding in Ogan Komering Ulu, South Sumatra, affected 1,695 families and displaced 257, causing substantial material losses[24].",
