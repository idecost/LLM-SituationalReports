    "summary": "Afghanistan is experiencing severe flooding across its western, northern, and northeastern regions, marking the largest flooding event this year and affecting thousands of families[18]. These floods have led to significant casualties, with at least 347 fatalities and over 1,651 injuries reported in Baghlan, Badakhshan, and Takhar provinces alone, and overall casualties are expected to increase[27]. The disaster has caused extensive damage to infrastructure, including approximately 9,000 homes, vital bridges, roads, health facilities, and schools, while also destroying nearly 14,000 livestock and 24,000 hectares of agricultural land, making many affected areas inaccessible[33]. Humanitarian organizations such as WHO, WFP, and UNICEF, along with various clusters (Health, Protection, Shelter, Food Security and Agriculture Cluster), are actively providing emergency response, including medical supplies, food assistance, emergency shelter, hygiene kits, and addressing critical needs like clean water, mental health support, and disease surveillance[17]. While some food prices saw a negligible decrease in May 2024, they remain significantly higher than pre-COVID levels, and acute malnutrition is above emergency thresholds in most provinces[16]. Additionally, Afghanistan continues to manage the return of over 589,700 individuals recorded up to May 18, 2024, primarily from Pakistan[55].",

In addition, the blockade of the Herat to Ghor road is hindering the delivery of emergency supplies from Herat, exacerbating the challenges faced by relief efforts.Poverty and a lack of community awareness regarding communicable diseases are significant obstacles to effective response and recovery efforts.",
