    "summary": "Jamaica is facing widespread destruction and significant humanitarian needs after Hurricane Beryl made landfall as a Category 5 storm on July 3rd[48]. Southern coastal areas, including parishes like St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, Manchester, Westmoreland, and Hanover, were most severely impacted, suffering extensive damage to telecommunications, water, electricity, health infrastructure, housing, public buildings, agriculture, and fishing livelihoods[49]. Many communities remain without access to clean water, sanitation, and electricity, with 70% of National Water Commission customers initially without water and power restoration in the worst areas projected to take four to eight weeks[34]. Two deaths have been confirmed, and approximately 1,876 people, including 113 children, are in shelters[42]. In response, the Government of Jamaica declared a disaster area and launched the Relief Emergency Assistance and Community Help (REACH) program for recovery, focusing on distributing food and essential supplies, restoring utilities, and supporting housing and economic recovery, while formally accepting support from the United Nations[50]. The UN, through its Resident Coordinator and the activated UN Emergency Technical Team (UNETT), which is co-shared by UNICEF and WFP, has deployed UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) teams for joint assessments and is coordinating international assistance, including a US$4 million allocation from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) for Jamaica and other affected Caribbean nations[50]. Agencies like UNICEF are providing prepositioned water, hygiene, and dignity supplies, and planning for disease prevention, psycho-social support, and cash transfers, while FAO is conducting damage assessments using advanced technology to aid agricultural recovery[17]. Humanitarian access and communication remain challenging in affected areas, hindering aid delivery and assessment efforts[8].",

Efforts are being made by Digicel Jamaica to restore connectivity in St Elizabeth[26]. The government is speaking with telecommunications providers Digicel and Flow regarding coverage[27]. There is an effort to get across the network and utilize as many community leaders as possible to work with Members of Parliament[29].

This includes damage and needs assessment using drones and satellite remote sensing, along with ground-level data collection through surveys and key informant interviews, all of which will guide response and recovery planning[32][33][34]. USAID also has disaster experts on the ground in Jamaica actively supporting damage assessments and coordination efforts[35].\n*   **Direct Assistance and Financial Support:** Families in southern coastal areas, including Clarendon, Manchester, and St. Elizabeth, are in need of access to clean water, food, and reconstruction supplies for their homes, as well as psychological support[36][37]. In St Elizabeth, the Jamaica Public Service (JPS) Foundation and Food For The Poor (FFTP) Jamaica are providing care packages and access to charging stations[38]. Support to social protection systems is being implemented, including potential provision of food assistance to affected populations through existing government systems and modalities, and direct World Food Programme (WFP) assistance as required, utilizing cash-based transfers (CBT) and/or vouchers[34]. Investments in CBT assistance are expected to be complemented by a top-up of Jamaica's Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) policy, which, if triggered, will direct a fixed percentage of a potential CCRIF payout towards providing cash transfers to impacted people via the country's social protection system[39].\n*   **Infrastructure Restoration:** Hurricane Beryl most severely impacted Jamaica's southern coastal areas, causing damage to telecommunications, infrastructure, housing, public buildings, and healthcare facilities[37]. The Jamaica Public Service (JPS) and the National Water Commission (NWC) are working to restore utility services, including electricity and water, in affected communities[36].",
