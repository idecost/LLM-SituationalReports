    "summary": "The situation in Gaza is dire, marked by ongoing Israeli military operations, including renewed ground invasions and persistent airstrikes that have repeatedly targeted schools and other shelters for internally displaced persons, causing numerous fatalities, including children and women[17]. Over the past year, the conflict has resulted in more than 41,500 to 50,000 Palestinian deaths and approximately 100,000 injuries in Gaza, with thousands still missing, while 101 hostages remain captive[81]. Nearly 1.9 million people are displaced, facing a severe humanitarian crisis with widespread acute malnutrition among children, intentional blocking of food and medicine, and a devastated healthcare system where only half of hospitals are partially operational and mental health needs have tripled[75]. Infrastructure is extensively damaged, including over 68% of cropland and roads, and a significant number of housing units, contributing to an environmental catastrophe with contaminated water and the re-emergence of polio[76]. The West Bank also experiences escalating violence and damage[73], prompting international calls for an immediate ceasefire, full humanitarian access, and accountability for international law violations[50].",

The capacity to conduct repairs or provide alternative places for families is limited, preventing practical support for those in damaged buildings beyond awareness-raising[6].\n*   **Food and Water:** There is insufficient food, water, and sanitation[6]. A major problem is the shortage of food and water[6]. Food prices are exorbitantly high, with vegetables being 10 times more expensive than before the war, and a kilo of tomatoes reaching nearly 10 (or 8)[5].\n*   **Sanitation:** There is insufficient food, water, and sanitation[6].\n*   **General Conditions:** IDP sites are in dire condition, with a continued spread of skin diseases and an acute lack of medications[8].

Approximately 17,000 children are unaccompanied or separated[75], and 625,000 children have been out of school for a whole year[77].\n\nGeneral challenges affecting both women and children include the devastating impact of the conflict[75], with more than 41,000 people killed and 96,000 injured[74]. The destruction of Gaza's infrastructure has been catastrophic[78], with around 68% of cropland and roads either destroyed or severely damaged[79]. Only 17 of 36 hospitals remain partially functional[79], all suffering from a lack of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water[79]. Humanitarian aid movement in Gaza remains \"very dangerous\"[80].

Thousands of bodies are still under rubble and in the streets, unreachable by rescue and medical teams[81]. Israel is also intentionally blocking deliveries of food and medicine[75].\n\nHumanitarian organizations are addressing these challenges in several ways:\n*   Oxfam partner Juzoor is supporting hundreds of thousands of people in over 90 shelters and health points across Gaza[74].\n*   UNICEF has vaccinated thousands of children for polio in the area[74].\n*   Oxfam is calling for an immediate, permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages and unlawfully detained Palestinians, and an end to all lethal arms sales to Israel[76].\n*   Oxfam also demands full humanitarian access to Gaza[76]and urges the international community to enforce accountability by addressing the illegal Israeli occupation, removing settlements in the occupied West Bank, and providing reparations to affected Palestinian communities[76].",
