    "summary": "Haiti is currently facing a worsening humanitarian crisis driven by alarming rates of armed gang violence, which has severely disrupted daily life, forced mass displacement, and exacerbated acute food insecurity[63][139][142]. Armed gangs control nearly 80% of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince and are expanding into rural regions, terrorizing residents with killings, rapes, and kidnappings, while also impeding the movement of people and goods[3]. A recent attack on October 3, 2024, in the Pont Sond area of the Artibonite department, resulted in at least 70 deaths and 357 injuries, displacing an estimated 6,270 people[135][136][138]. Over 700,000 people are internally displaced across the country, a 22% increase since June, with many lacking essential food, water, shelter, and medical care[75]. Nearly half of Haiti's population, over 5 million people, is experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or worse) between August 2024 and February 2025, including 6,000 people facing catastrophic hunger (IPC Phase 5) and 2 million at emergency levels (IPC Phase 4)[124][139][142]. In response to the escalating violence, Prime Minister Garry Conille announced a joint operation with Kenyan police on August 29, 2024, to target criminal gangs in Port-au-Prince[129], and a UN-backed Kenyan mission, which began in late June, is working to quell violence but requires substantial additional personnel and resources[63]. The crisis also poses severe protection risks for children, with an average of five killed per week in the first half of 2024, and leaves women and girls highly vulnerable to gender-based violence[41].",

Some families depend on remittances, but this money barely lasts a week[8], leading to an inability to provide food daily[5].\n*   **Scarcity and infrequent availability of food:** Food does not come around very often[2], and it is very rare for individuals to get a meal a day[2][5]. The available food is often insufficient, with quantities meant for one person needing to feed ten[5].\n*   **Competition for aid:** When organizations provide food, there is a major fight[7].\n*   **Vulnerability leading to desperate measures:** In displacement camps, young girls are coerced into trading sex for food[6].",

Gang violence has so far forced more than 110,000 people to flee their homes in the last 7 months, particularly in Gressier, west of the capital. \"The sharp rise in displacement underscores the urgent need for a sustained humanitarian response,\" said Grgoire Goodstein, IOM Chief in Haiti. \"We call on the international community to step up its support for Haiti's displaced populations and the host communities that continue to show remarkable resilience in the face of these challenges.",

Many of these displaced individuals face severe shortages of food, water, shelter, and medical care, in addition to severe protection risks[3][4].\n*   **Issues with National Police and Corruption:** Rights advocates have called for more support and training for Haiti's national police force, as well as an end to corruption[10].\n\nWhile the Head of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH), Maria Isabel Salvador, is noted to have met with key stakeholders, including Haitian officials and other UN agencies[1], the provided sources do not explicitly detail specific challenges faced by BINUH in coordinating with Haitian authorities and other stakeholders[10].",

                    "updated_retrieved_answer": "Current living conditions in displacement sites contribute to an increased risk of gender-based violence (GBV) for women and girls due to poor living conditions and a lack of basic necessities, resources, food, and water[11][12][14]. Food insecurity, along with the scarcity and high costs of products at markets, amplifies their vulnerability to violence, sexual exploitation, and abuse, leading to increased reliance on harmful coping mechanisms[13][15]. Specific risks in surveyed displacement sites include more than half of latrines and many showers not being separated by gender, several showers lacking locks, and many sites without nighttime lighting[18]. Additionally, groups of armed men often attack women and girls as they travel to work or school[14].\n\nTo improve safety and security, women and girls urgently need protection services, as well as access to reproductive health services, shelter, food, water, sanitation, and hygiene[13][15]. UNFPA and its partners deploy mobile teams to IDP sites to provide integrated sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and GBV services[13][16]. They also offer remote psychosocial support, referrals, case documentation, and GBV information via a hotline, and conduct awareness-raising activities on GBV and SRH[13][16]. Four temporary women and girls' safe spaces are operational in sites to address gaps in psychosocial support and case management services[16]. UNFPA continues to support and strengthen GBV coordination mechanisms at the national level and among humanitarian actors, and works to mainstream GBV into the humanitarian response[13][16]. Improving overall security conditions is also the primary factor reported by households considering returning home[11]. However, current efforts to protect women and girls from violence are not being delivered at the scale needed, with only 15 out of 85 IDP sites in Haiti currently receiving protection services[15][17].",

                    "updated_retrieved_answer": "The primary barriers preventing internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Metropolitan Area of Port-au-Prince (MAPAP) and other displacement sites from accessing essential protection services include:\n\n*   **Limited Service Availability:** Only 15 out of 85 IDP sites in Haiti receive protection services, including those for survivors of gender-based violence (GBV)[31][32]. Current efforts to protect women and girls from violence are not being delivered at the scale needed[31][32].\n*   **Insecurity and Violence:** Humanitarian access is challenged by risks of attacks and abductions[33]. Insecurity blocks access to safe spaces[37]. Criminal incidents, including armed robberies, burglaries, and kidnappings, have increased, particularly in MAPAP[33][34]. Groups of armed men often attack women and girls as they travel[33].\n*   **Poor Living Conditions:** The risks of sexual violence in displacement sites have risen due to poor living conditions[33][34]. Specific issues include more than half of latrines and many showers not separated by gender, several showers lacking locks, and many sites without nighttime lighting[38].\n*   **Lack of Resources and Capacity:** Access to health services after sexual violence is scarce[37]. Only 3% of rape cases were treated within 72 hours due to access constraints, a lack of medicine, inadequate resources for case management and referrals, inadequacy or absence of care facilities, and a lack of trained staff[37].\n*   **Underreporting:** GBV cases are likely underreported due to fear of revictimization and stigmatization, and the lack of an effective justice system[37].\n*   **Funding Shortfalls:** A $674 million humanitarian appeal for Haiti has received just over a third (36%) of its funding[34][40], and UNFPA has mobilized only 19% of its required funding[40].\n*   **Food Insecurity and High Costs:** Food insecurity, scarcity, and high costs of market products amplify the vulnerability of women and girls to violence, sexual exploitation, and abuse, increasing reliance on harmful coping mechanisms[32][36].\n\nTo address these barriers and ensure comprehensive support for survivors of GBV:\n\n*   **Increase Service Provision:** Urgent needs include protection services, reproductive health services, shelter, food, water, sanitation, and hygiene[32].\n*   **Improve Security:** Improving security conditions is the primary factor reported by households considering returning home[34][40]. The Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission continues to support the Haitian National Police to secure public safety and protect critical infrastructure[38][39][40].\n*   **Deploy Mobile and Remote Services:** UNFPA and its partners deploy mobile teams to IDP sites to provide integrated sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and GBV services[35][36]. They also offer remote psychosocial support, referrals, case documentation, and GBV information via a hotline[35].\n*   **Establish Safe Spaces:** Four temporary women and girls' safe spaces are operational in sites to address gaps in psychosocial support and case management services[35].\n*   **Strengthen Coordination and Capacity:** UNFPA continues to strengthen GBV coordination mechanisms among humanitarian actors and build the capacities of other sectors to mainstream GBV into the humanitarian response[35]. A round table was held for GBV actors, women's associations, government, UN agencies, and NGOs to identify concrete actions[33].\n*   **Conduct Awareness Activities:** Project HOPE provided mental health and GBV awareness activities to 9,974 people[39]. UNFPA conducts awareness-raising activities on GBV and SRH and available services[35].",

It continues to rend the social fabric, multiplying human rights violations and plunging thousands of families into distress[21]. Insecurity is omnipresent, paralyzing the economy and undermining institutions[21]. The violence has left over 700,000 people homeless in recent years[23], with more than 700,000 people now displaced, over half of whom are children[24]. It disrupts daily life, forces people to flee their homes, and causes acute food insecurity to rise[23]. More than 3,600 people had been killed in gang violence this year as of last week[24], with an estimated 3,661 killed since January, amounting to over 13 deaths daily[27][28].\n\nTo mitigate these impacts, a UN-backed Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission led by Kenya began in late June[23]. This mission aims to quell gang violence[24]and maintain its gains to enhance national security and establish conditions for free and fair elections[21]. Around 600 Kenyan police officers were deployed between June and July 2024[25], with Jamaica deploying soldiers in September to support them[28]. Kenyan police have focused on crucial defense duties, including protecting key infrastructure like airports and oil terminals[25]. The mission has achieved some initial successes, including securing the airport and other key infrastructure[26]. However, officials state much work remains[23], and there are calls for increased international financial and logistical assistance to the MSS mission[24][27][28]. The mission needs to rapidly achieve the full deployment of its envisioned 2,500 personnel, up from the current 410 officers, and secure substantial resources[26]. Kenya plans to send 600 more police officers to Haiti from this month to January[29].",

                    "updated_retrieved_answer": "Child protection actors in Haiti face several primary challenges in accessing and assisting children affected by armed violence, particularly those escaping armed groups. Access is constrained by numerous checkpoints set up by heavily armed gangs along National Roads 1, 2, and 3 in Port-au-Prince (PAP) and Artibonite, which limits the humanitarian response[11]. Armed groups often do not permit humanitarian assistance, especially in Artibonite and certain areas of PAP[11]. There is a demand for unfettered access for aid workers and life-saving supplies across Haiti, particularly in Port-au-Prince[20]. Additionally, there is limited capacity to assist children escaping armed violence[16], and a need for sufficient child protection capacities[13]. Challenges also include a lack of information on separated and unaccompanied children, their needs, and the conflict's impact on their lives[15][20]. Furthermore, there is a call for the urgent mobilization of resources and increased humanitarian funding for Haiti[14].",
