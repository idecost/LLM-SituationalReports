    "summary": "Ukraine is experiencing a multifaceted crisis characterized by ongoing hostilities and significant humanitarian challenges. The Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS) continues to monitor the status of health facilities and identify service gaps[79], while nuclear safety and security, particularly at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), remain vulnerable with frequent external power outages and only one of four 750 kV power lines operational[28]. The country is still recovering from the Kakhovka Dam destruction a year prior, which resulted in devastating flooding, at least 15 deaths, damage to over 37,000 houses, and disrupted water supply for a million people[83]. Education activities in regions like Sumska, Donetska, and Kharkivska oblasts aim to restore normalcy for children amidst displacement and intensified missile attacks, with educational consultation points in Donetska oblast temporarily suspended and evacuations of families with children initiated in May 2024 due to worsening security[89][90]. Telecommunications infrastructure has also been severely affected, including a major cyberattack in December 2023 that disrupted mobile signals for millions, and temporary internet services were deployed in Odesa in May due to intensified shelling[49]. Economically, direct damage to Ukraine has reached USD 155 billion, with economic losses at USD 499 billion, and reconstruction efforts are estimated to cost over USD 486 billion[87]. Efforts are underway to address legal issues such as housing compensation[92]and provide mental health and psychosocial support to over 117,000 people[46], with calls for women's inclusive participation in reconstruction processes[5].",

            "cluster_summary": "Owners of destroyed housing in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine face significant legal challenges that hinder their ability to receive compensation through the eRecovery program. One major issue is the difficulty in property registration. Most Bureaus of Technical Inventory (BTIs) in these areas were not relocated to government-controlled territories and have often been damaged, destroyed, or looted. This situation makes it nearly impossible to obtain the necessary information for state registration of property rights (SRPR), which is a precondition for applying for compensation through the eRecovery program[3][5][6][31][32][34]. The law mandates that state registrars obtain information from BTIs for state registration of rights, but this requirement becomes a significant barrier when BTIs are inaccessible[5][6][31][32]. Owners who acquired property before 2013 face additional challenges, as they struggle to register their rights in the SRPR even with hard copies of title documents, often necessitating a judicial procedure to recognize their ownership, which involves court fees and the burden of proof[3][4][6][8][34].\n\nInheritance issues further complicate matters, as notaries frequently refuse to open inheritance cases for properties in temporarily occupied territories, likely due to potential legal liabilities. This forces heirs to seek court confirmation of ownership in the order of inheritance, again requiring court fees and proof[8][9]. These legal hurdles directly impede an owner's ability to meet the SRPR registration requirement, which is essential for eRecovery compensation[4][6].\n\nThe eRecovery program itself is limited in scope, providing compensation only for housing destruction, as assessing damage levels via satellite images is not feasible[4][6]. Although there are plans to expand the program to other temporarily occupied territories, such as Mariupol and Bakhmut, these expansions depend on funding support. A draft law related to this expansion is currently registered in the Parliament and is preparing for a second reading[1][2][4].\n\nIn the broader context, services and housing stock in areas where the Government of Ukraine is regaining control are under stress due to increased demand, a situation affecting virtually every Oblast in the country[11]. These regions, previously under occupation and on the frontlines of war, have seen their infrastructure and services severely impacted[11]. Additionally, there has been a rapid increase in requests for technical documentation and cadastral numbers for horticultural land plots[21][22]. To address this, the legislator has initiated amendments to the Law on land plots allocation, extending the deadline for registering land ownership from January 1, 2025, to January 1, 2028[21][26]. These amendments, passed in parliament and awaiting the Presidential signature, aim to alleviate the backlog and prevent unregistered land from being considered free and sold by the state[21][26].",

The ETC utilized its existing Remote Site on Vehicle (RSoV) and satellite solutions to deliver the service. By May 9, all community members were registered using the new network, and the ETC service concluded [1][2][3][5].\n\nMeanwhile, the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) is facing significant challenges with its power lines and external power situation. The plant's electricity grid has been severely impacted by the conflict, leading to repeated losses of connections to all its power lines. The external power situation is extremely vulnerable and prone to frequent outages. Before the conflict, ZNPP had four 750 kV lines available, but only one remains, and this line is unavailable due to damage sustained earlier in the conflict, away from the site [21][22]. \n\nRegarding repair plans, the ZNPP is not currently planning to complete repairs at this time. These issues affect the plant's operations as a loss of off-site power has the potential to be more serious due to higher nuclear fuel temperatures for reactors in operation in Ukraine. Director General Grossi reiterated that the ZNPP would not be re-started as long as nuclear safety and security remained in jeopardy due to the conflict. However, IAEA experts were informed that nuclear safety and security is being maintained despite the ongoing conflict [21][22].",

            "cluster_summary": "The partially functional field hospital in Rafah faces significant challenges, primarily due to its inaccessibility caused by hostilities in the area. This situation limits the hospital to providing only basic services to patients within its confines. The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the urgent need to restore hospitals in Rafah to improve access and functionality [1].\n\nIn a related humanitarian crisis, the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station led to severe flooding, deeply affecting residents emotionally. Many, like Olha Panich, are distressed, recalling how the flooding of lower streets, riverbanks, houses, and gardens forced people to relocate to higher ground [11][12][13]. In response to these challenges, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, has been actively providing medical services and medicines through mobile clinics in affected areas, including the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions [20]. These clinics are staffed by a dedicated team of doctors, paramedics, nurses, social workers, and psychologists [15].\n\nIn Novosofiyivka, Mykolaiv region, most residents seeking consultations at MSF mobile clinics are elderly women [21][24][30]. The health needs observed include cardiovascular diseases, prompting MSF health promoters to educate on prevention strategies. MSF doctors also monitor blood pressure and blood sugar levels, prescribing necessary medications [28]. The mobile clinics operate in local medical units, ensuring continued access to healthcare by utilizing a single bridge that remained unflooded, allowing MSF teams to reach patients on the other side of the river [21][22]. Supplies are also sent by boat from the village of Fedorivka, located across the river [21][22]. On the inaccessible side, MSF was the sole organization providing medical services and medicines at that time [23][29].\n\nThe flooding also caused a severe shortage of drinking water in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, as wells and boreholes were inundated [31][34]. To address this, MSF purchased large quantities of water and storage containers, distributing them to residents [34][38]. They also provided packs with water and water disinfectants, which residents transported by boat [35]. In communities along the Inhulets River, where all wells and boreholes were flooded, MSF faced challenges reaching the opposite bank [43][44]. Volunteers played a crucial role in transporting water, water disinfectants, and medicine kits by boat [41][42].\n\nOn the inaccessible side of the river, MSF remained the sole provider of medical services and medicines [51][55]. This shortage had serious health implications, as illustrated by a patient with dangerously high blood sugar levels, for whom no immediate medical help was available [54][56]. To mitigate these issues, MSF continued to distribute water and medical supplies, sending them by boat from Fedorivka [52][54]. They also relied on volunteers to transport essential packs across the river [55][56]. The MSF team utilized the unflooded bridge to maintain patient access to healthcare [52][54]. Their mobile clinics, staffed by a comprehensive team, continue to offer medical services, transport patients to hospitals, and support frontline hospitals with medical donations [51][60]. Despite these efforts, the sources do not specify additional resources needed beyond what MSF is currently providing.",

            "cluster_summary": "The embedding of CashCap experts within the Ukraine Red Cross Society (URCS) played a pivotal role in enhancing the organization's position and capabilities in Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA). These experts were instrumental in positioning URCS effectively in external coordination forums, notably the Cash Working Groups (CWGs), where URCS attained co-chair status. This achievement was facilitated by the experts' leadership and training efforts, which significantly contributed to URCS taking on more significant roles in external coordination structures and gaining visibility among donors and international organizations, thereby granting them CVA legitimacy as a large cash actor[1][2][4][11][12][13][14][20].\n\nThe experts' contributions extended beyond coordination, as they facilitated partnerships and collaboration with the government and other stakeholders. They provided expertise in coordination, capacity-strengthening, policy influence, and advocacy for quality CVA. This included enhancing CVA skills and competence within URCS, contributing to documentation development, and improving information management[11][12][18]. As a result, URCS gained a deeper understanding of its role with the government and became the sole partner of the Ministry of Reintegration and Occupied Policy since September 2022, handling registration, payment, Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM), and Community Engagement and Accountability (CEA)[13][15][20].\n\nURCS also implemented a no-regret cash in envelope for 270,000 recipients for the Ministry of Reintegration and Occupied Policy and managed 100,000 recipients per month for host community members hosting Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)[15][20]. Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) were established with the government, further solidifying URCS's role and visibility[20].\n\nDespite these advancements, perceived gaps remained within URCS, such as not being fully cash ready, a gap in understanding at the branch level, and the absence of sectoral cash[21][34]. To address these challenges, interviewees, particularly from National Societies, advocated for a more structured deployment with clearer objectives and increased involvement in expert selection. They proposed involving the National Society and CashCap directly in decision-making and Terms of Reference (ToRs) drafting, along with regular partner check-ins[30]. About half of the interviewees suggested a more structured approach for future deployments, emphasizing the importance of interpersonal skills and involvement in setting objectives and expert selection[30].\n\nCashCap experts addressed these challenges by significantly enhancing CVA skills and competence in Ukraine through daily teaching, mentoring, collective capacity-building activities, and quality feedback and reporting. Their knowledge of cash coordination and extensive experience in CVA were crucial in facilitating these improvements[31][33][34]. The experts' leadership and training efforts were key in URCS attaining co-chair status in the CWG, further empowering the organization and enhancing its visibility[39].",

It aims to identify existing gaps and establish intervention priorities by monitoring the availability of essential services and the challenges impeding access to these services[1][2][11][12][18]. HeRAMS provides detailed reports on the status of health facilities, focusing on the availability of essential services and the challenges that hinder access[1][11]. The data collection process includes questions about factors that impede functionality, although the primary challenges are not explicitly listed in the sources provided[8]. Data is consistently collected and updated for all accessible public health facilities, with a stratified sample for verification based on the type of health facility, including Multi-Profile Health Facilities (MPHFs) and Primary Health Centers (PHCs)[18][31][32][35]. The healthcare facilities are selected randomly for this verification process[31].\n\nSince the escalation of the conflict on February 24, 2022, attacks have damaged numerous health facilities in Ukraine[11]. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collects information on civilian harm from conflict-related violence using a wide range of sources, including interviews with victims, their relatives, and witnesses; open-source information; forensic records; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organizations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; and data from medical facilities and local authorities[23]. All sources and information are assessed for relevance and credibility and cross-checked[23]. Despite these efforts, the UN notes that the actual extent of civilian harm, including casualties and infrastructure damage, is likely considerably higher due to the large number of reports and the lack of access to relevant areas, particularly from the period immediately after the full-scale armed attack[22][25]. Requests by the UN to access Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation are consistently denied[22].\n\nThe UN has verified cases of harm, including the killing and maiming of Ukrainian children, with more than 600 children killed and 1,420 injured since the escalation of Russia's invasion in February 2022[21][22][27]. Children in frontline regions have spent the equivalent of seven months underground in bomb shelters due to relentless attacks[24]. In response, the UN works with the Government to provide the care these children desperately need[21]. Since the beginning of the war, over 117,000 people, including refugees, internally displaced persons, and host communities, have benefited from mental health and psychosocial support services in Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, and Georgia[25]. The Secretary-General officially listed Russia for the killing and maiming of Ukrainian children in 2023[21].",

Regular consultations with authorities are essential to assess the security conditions in various areas. Additionally, the heads of military administrations are responsible for pre-determining evacuation routes and ensuring the availability of transit hubs, although the specific challenges they face in this task are not detailed in the sources[1][21].\n\nIn response to the security challenges, online educational and wellbeing support is provided to children in locations such as Dobropillia, Druzhkivka, and Kramatorsk, particularly where the security situation hinders offline learning services[1]. Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is actively responding to Ukraine's requests for technical support and assistance to re-establish a robust nuclear safety and security regime at its nuclear facilities and in activities involving radioactive sources. The progress made by the Agency in these efforts is documented, although specific details of the technical support and assistance are not provided[11][32].\n\nThe implementation of safeguards in Ukraine, as outlined in the Agreement Between Ukraine and the IAEA for the Application of Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Protocol Additional thereto, is summarized in a report that highlights relevant aspects under the current circumstances[31]. The Director General has been requested to continue closely monitoring the situation regarding nuclear safety, security, and safeguards in Ukraine, with regular formal reports to the Board of Governors on these matters[32].",

These efforts focus on ensuring access to learning and wellbeing activities in safe spaces within Kharkiv city and oblast, particularly when online education is compromised due to increased missile attacks and damage to civil infrastructure, such as electricity and internet outages[1]. Key measures include supporting access to wellbeing and learning in safe spaces[7], providing education for school-age evacuees[8], and facilitating offline learning and wellbeing activities for both displaced and host community children to help them keep up with formal schooling and minimize learning losses[1]. Additionally, support is extended to teachers affected by escalations, displacement, increased workload, and challenges in supporting their students[1][11].\n\nSpecific initiatives include the provision of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) for children, incorporating social-emotional learning and informal education support[1]. Learning kits and electronic devices are distributed to aid learning[1], and safe spaces such as Temporary Learning Spaces and Digital Learning Centers are established for children to play and receive wellbeing and learning support[1]. Catch-up learning support services are also available to help children regain access to formal education[1], alongside wellbeing support services for teachers[1][11].\n\nIn Donetska oblast, as of May 29, 2024, the regional commission on technogenic and environmental safety and emergencies has mandated the evacuation of families with children from specific areas, including Lyman and several villages within the Lymanska, Hrodivska, and Illinivska hromadas[31][34]. This evacuation is coordinated with the Coordination Headquarters for mandatory evacuation under martial law conditions, with military administration heads tasked with planning evacuation routes and transit hub availability[31]. For evacuated children, wellbeing and educational support is provided in safe spaces[32][33][35]. Online learning access is maintained amid intensified missile attacks and educational infrastructure damage[32][33]. When security permits, offline learning and wellbeing activities are organized for both displaced and host community children to support their engagement with formal schooling and mitigate learning losses[32][33].

There is a recognized need for psychological assistance and rest for children traumatized by the war[31].\n\nIn Sumska oblast, tailored wellbeing and educational support services address the needs of displaced children by providing safe spaces for learning and wellbeing[45][47]. Online learning is facilitated amidst intensified missile attacks and infrastructure damage[41][45]. Offline learning and wellbeing activities are available for both displaced and host community children, contingent on the security situation, to help them remain engaged with formal schooling and reduce potential learning losses[42][45]. Teachers facing similar challenges due to escalations and displacement receive necessary support[43][45].
