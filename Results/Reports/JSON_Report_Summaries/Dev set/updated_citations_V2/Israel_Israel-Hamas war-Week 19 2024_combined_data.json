    "summary": "Israeli military operations are escalating in Rafah, Gaza, with Israeli forces seizing the Rafah border crossing on Tuesday, which was a main entry point for aid, thereby dashing ceasefire hopes[5]. This seizure, along with the closure of the Kerem Shalom crossing, has halted the entry of fuel and aid into Gaza, creating a disastrous situation for humanitarian response and depleting critical supplies[12]. Israel has issued evacuation orders for parts of Rafah, causing chaos and panic among the population, with over 150,000 people having fled in recent days and around 300,000 affected by the orders[26]. Vulnerable individuals, including malnourished infants and injured patients, are among those forced to move to already overcrowded and unsafe areas like Al-Mawasi and Khan Younis, which lack adequate shelter and humanitarian supplies[26]. UN officials and humanitarian partners warn that these operations will lead to more death, displacement, and a humanitarian catastrophe, emphasizing that there are no safe spaces in Gaza[13]. Meanwhile, ceasefire talks are stalled, as Hamas accepted a proposal that Israel deemed unacceptable, particularly regarding a permanent end to hostilities[11], and violations against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have also substantially increased[31].",

According to Scott Anderson from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), no aid is being received, and the crossing area remains an active war zone[11]. The Rafah crossing, the main entry point for aid into Gaza, was seized by Israeli forces, further complicating the situation[12][13]. Since last Sunday, no aid has entered Gaza by land, and the closure has severed access to fuel, affecting the entry of critical relief items and restricting the movement of aid workers[14][15].\n\nFuel is critically needed for humanitarian operations, with current stocks nearly depleted. Andrea de Domenico from the UN humanitarian affairs office (OCHA) reported that humanitarians have only about 30,000 litres of diesel available, while they typically require 200,000 litres daily[16][17][18]. The lack of fuel is disastrous for the humanitarian response, as noted by Scott Anderson, and could run out \"tomorrow,\" impacting essential services like health, water, and communication[15][14]. Aid agencies are nearly out of food and fuel, with stocks of critical supplies being depleted hourly[19][17][15].\n\nThe situation is exacerbated by Israeli military actions, including attacks on Rafah and evacuation orders, which have forced tens of thousands to flee[12][11][20][17][18]. These displaced individuals have nowhere safe to go, as designated evacuation sites like Al-Mawasi are overstretched, lack vital services, and are unsafe[15]. The ongoing hostilities have made the situation extremely fluid, with no safe zones in Gaza[11][18].\n\nUNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini emphasized the need to \"reconstitute our stock to be able to resume distribution in the south of the Gaza Strip\"[21]. However, the closure of the Rafah crossing has cut off access to fuel and critical relief items, curtailing the movement of aid workers[14]. The lack of fuel has also caused bakeries to stop working, leading to a shortage of bread, and has affected the water supply[22].\n\nDespite a ceasefire proposal accepted by Hamas and mediated by Egypt and Qatar, Israel's response was cautious, stating the proposal was far from meeting \"necessary requirements\"[12]. The Israeli military's actions, including the seizure of the Rafah crossing, have dashed hopes for a ceasefire and further complicated the humanitarian situation[11][15].\n\nHumanitarian teams in Rafah, where over 1 million people, including 600,000 children, remain, face significant challenges[17][18][23][12]. The safety of humanitarian workers is a concern, and more than a quarter of humanitarian missions to northern Gaza in April were impeded by Israeli authorities, with 10 percent denied[13][24][20]. The ongoing military operations and hostilities continue to threaten the delivery of new aid supplies, leaving the people of Gaza in a precarious situation[18][15].",

This shortage affects everything from the movement and distribution of food to the operation of hospitals, emergency services, sewage treatment, and telecommunications, with fuel critical for these operations potentially running out soon[25][14]. The situation is exacerbated by the halt in aid flow through the Rafah crossing, with no aid trucks entering since May 5[26]. The Rafah and Karem Abu Salem crossings, which were vital entry points for limited aid, have been disrupted[27]. Israeli forces have seized the Rafah crossing, blocking the passage for people and humanitarian aid, resulting in no fuel or aid entering the Gaza Strip, which is disastrous for the humanitarian response[26]. This closure has also severed access to fuel, affecting the entry of critical relief items and curtailing the movement of aid workers[14].\n\nThe humanitarian crisis is further compounded by the lack of safe places in Gaza, as Israel has repeatedly attacked so-called 'safe zones'[26]. Other towns, such as Khan Younis, have been reduced to rubble and remain under attack, making them unsafe[25]. Evacuation orders have uprooted tens of thousands of people in Rafah, sowing fear and confusion among civilians[27]. The meagre humanitarian aid reaching people will be severely disrupted, and the closure of crossings will lead to increased hunger and scarcity[28][14].\n\nEfforts to achieve a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas face significant obstacles. Israel has rejected proposals that do not meet its \"core demands\"[29] and maintains a \"red line\" against a permanent end to hostilities[30]. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that he will not accept an end to the war, asserting that Israel has \"no choice\" but to destroy Hamas, which is his goal[31][30]. Conversely, Hamas finds it unacceptable to release hostages without an assurance of a permanent ceasefire[30]. Hamas has indicated that Israel's rejection of the mediators' proposal has returned negotiations to \"the first square\"[29], with a senior Hamas official noting that \"occupation Israelis turned against the mediators' proposal\"[32]. Hamas had agreed to a framework proposal that diverged from the one Israel had helped craft[33].\n\nThe situation is further strained by Israel's renewed military activity in Rafah, its plan for an all-out assault on the area, and the seizure of the Rafah crossing by Israeli forces, which have dashed hopes for a ceasefire[29][34]. The UN Secretary-General has called on both Hamas and Israel \"to show political courage\" to secure a ceasefire[35].",
