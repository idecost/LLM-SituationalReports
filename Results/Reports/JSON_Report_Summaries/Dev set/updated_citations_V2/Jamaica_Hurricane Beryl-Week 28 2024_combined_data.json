    "summary": "Jamaica is facing widespread destruction and significant humanitarian needs after Hurricane Beryl made landfall as a Category 5 storm on July 3rd[47]. Southern coastal areas, including parishes like St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, Manchester, Westmoreland, and Hanover, were most severely impacted, suffering extensive damage to telecommunications, water, electricity, health infrastructure, housing, public buildings, agriculture, and fishing livelihoods[48]. Many communities remain without access to clean water, sanitation, and electricity, with 70% of National Water Commission customers initially without water and power restoration in the worst areas projected to take four to eight weeks[37]. Two deaths have been confirmed, and approximately 1,876 people, including 113 children, are in shelters[44]. In response, the Government of Jamaica declared a disaster area and launched the Relief Emergency Assistance and Community Help (REACH) program for recovery, focusing on distributing food and essential supplies, restoring utilities, and supporting housing and economic recovery, while formally accepting support from the United Nations[49]. The UN, through its Resident Coordinator and the activated UN Emergency Technical Team (UNETT), which is co-shared by UNICEF and WFP, has deployed UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) teams for joint assessments and is coordinating international assistance, including a US$4 million allocation from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) for Jamaica and other affected Caribbean nations[49]. Agencies like UNICEF are providing prepositioned water, hygiene, and dignity supplies, and planning for disease prevention, psycho-social support, and cash transfers, while FAO is conducting damage assessments using advanced technology to aid agricultural recovery[18]. Humanitarian access and communication remain challenging in affected areas, hindering aid delivery and assessment efforts[8].",

This initiative aims to mobilize resources and offer financial support to these severely impacted areas[1]. In support of this effort, the Seprod and Musson Foundations have pledged a donation of 2 million to the fund[2]. The UWJ is calling on private and public organizations to collaborate in strengthening the FRF initiative, which will facilitate access to essential resources such as seeds, equipment, and financial aid to help farmers restore their livelihoods[3].\n\nIn parallel, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is leveraging its Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA) to provide technical assistance and enhance its coordination and response capabilities in the affected regions[4]. This includes the rapid deployment of staff, field missions, logistics, partnerships, resource mobilization, and technical assistance activities[4]. FAO's efforts in the Caribbean, particularly in Jamaica, involve conducting rapid needs assessments and preparing proposals to restore production and livelihoods[5]. They are utilizing drones and satellite remote sensing for damage and needs assessment, complemented by ground-level data collection through surveys and key informant interviews to guide response and recovery planning[5].\n\nThe agricultural sector in Jamaica has suffered significant damage due to Hurricane Beryl, with preliminary assessments indicating that several crops, including vegetables and fruits, have been affected[5][4]. The livestock and fisheries sectors have also experienced considerable damage, including loss of fishing capacity, damage to vessels, support infrastructure, and fishing equipment[5][4]. The overall devastation has resulted in crop and infrastructure damage, livestock losses, soil erosion, and economic challenges for farmers, raising concerns about food security and livelihoods[6][4]. These impacts affect citizens' access to food and have repercussions throughout the agricultural supply chain in Jamaica[6][2].\n\nFAO is collaborating with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA) on a response plan that addresses the identified needs of producers and fishermen[7]. Mario Lubetkin, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Latin America and the Caribbean, has reiterated FAO's commitment to supporting Caribbean countries by mobilizing international cooperation for the recovery of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries production in the affected areas[4]. Although the specific financial damages to Jamaica's agricultural sector are not detailed, authorities estimate over US$6.4 million in damage to the agricultural sector in the affected countries[4]. The severe effects on agriculture threaten food security and the livelihoods of small producers, impacting everyone dependent on agriculture in Jamaica[5][4][2].",

            "cluster_summary": "Ongoing rains and debris are significantly obstructing access in Jamaica, delaying aid delivery and assessments, particularly in rural areas[8]. Humanitarian access is further challenged by flooding, debris from fallen trees, landslides, and infrastructural damage[9]. To address these challenges, recovery efforts include \"debushing and the carting away of debris\" and \"cleaning and desilting of drains\"[10]. The chief of defence staff has been instructed to mobilize the Disaster Assistance and Recovery Team and other supporting units, including engineers, to assist with rebuilding and recovery in areas with the greatest damage, such as Rocky Point and Portland Cottage[11].\n\nSocial workers are conducting daily assessments and providing support, including mattresses, food packages, and tarpaulins, to impacted residents[10]. The REACH (Relief Emergency Assistance and Community Help) programme is a key component of the relief efforts, focusing on the distribution of food and essential supplies through a transparent and non-partisan process[12]. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security has been distributing care packages, which contain enough food for a family of four for four days[12]. The government is coordinating the continued distribution of food, water, medical sundries, and other essentials to citizens in the most affected areas[12].\n\nTo ensure equitable distribution, the Prime Minister emphasized the need for a transparent process to prevent favoritism, stating that the system must properly identify \"the needy beneficiary and not the greedy person\"[13]. This relief is intended to be non-partisan, with distribution carried out by all members of parliament, emphasizing \"there is no colour or affiliation in a disaster\"[13][11]. The process relies on assessments from entities such as the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM), utilities, and public infrastructure[11]. Based on these assessments, constituencies are informed if they are categorized as \"severely impacted\"[14], and support is directed to communities where the damage is greatest, such as Rocky Point and Portland Cottage[11].\n\nThe risk of water and vector-borne diseases is a significant concern, particularly affecting children and their caregivers due to the rains and flooding[15]. To mitigate this risk, UNICEF is prepared to provide essential supplies for disease prevention, including repellent-impregnated mosquito nets and water purification supplies[15][16]. UNICEF also plans to deliver WASH dignity kits and cleaning kits to affected families, along with 10-liter water containers for proper water carrying and storage, and hand-washing stations in shelters[17]. Hygiene promotion is identified as a priority humanitarian need[18], and UNICEF has prepositioned technical assistance, water, hygiene, and dignity supplies for delivery to vulnerable children and adolescents[19].\n\nAn initial allocation of $5 million was provided for welfare activities, including food distribution, with an additional $4 million allocated to all 63 constituencies to assist in the recovery effort[13][14]. The criteria used to determine the allocation of resources involve a transparent assessment process conducted by ODPEM and other relevant entities[8]. This comprehensive approach aims to ensure that aid reaches those most in need, supporting communities where virtually the entire housing stock has been destroyed[11].",

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is actively involved in the Caribbean, including Jamaica, conducting rapid needs assessments and preparing proposals to restore production and livelihoods. This involves using drones and satellite remote sensing, alongside ground-level data collection through surveys and key informant interviews, to guide response and recovery planning[32][33][34]. USAID has also deployed disaster experts to Jamaica to support damage assessments and coordination efforts[35].\n\nThe hurricane severely impacted Jamaica's southern coastal areas, damaging telecommunications, infrastructure, housing, public buildings, and healthcare facilities[36]. The Jamaica Public Service (JPS) and the National Water Commission (NWC) are working to restore utility services, including electricity and water, in affected communities[37]. Additionally, the Jamaican government is prioritizing the fast-tracking of repairs to markets damaged by the hurricane, with significant impacts noted in the Falmouth, Mandeville, Lucea, and Old Harbour markets[38].\n\nDirect assistance and financial support are being provided to families in southern coastal areas, including Clarendon, Manchester, and St. Elizabeth, who are in need of clean water, food, and reconstruction supplies, as well as psychological support[37][36][39]. In St. Elizabeth, the JPS Foundation and Food For The Poor (FFTP) Jamaica are distributing care packages and providing access to charging stations[40]. The World Food Programme (WFP) is considering food assistance through existing government systems and modalities, and direct assistance via cash-based transfers (CBT) and/or vouchers[34]. Investments in CBT assistance are expected to be complemented by a top-up of Jamaica's Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) policy, which, if triggered, will allocate a fixed percentage of a potential payout towards cash transfers to impacted people via the country's social protection system[41].\n\nUSAID plans to provide market-based assistance to help residents purchase basic household commodities and other needed items[42]. They also intend to support logistical operations, repair homes, assist with water and sanitation needs, and provide essential relief items such as clean-up kits, hygiene kits, and tarps[42][35][40]. The Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) has been managing shelters, initially accommodating over 1,800 people in 156 of the 275 activated shelters, with 10 shelters remaining open as of the latest reports[43][44][45].\n\nState-run infirmaries across the island offer shelter and support services to the elderly, destitute, and mentally challenged individuals, with residents of the St Ann Infirmary currently occupying a school[38]. The National Arena, facilitated by the Red Cross, has been opened to accommodate residents[46]. A joint UN mission, including UNICEF, WFP, and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), observed the urgent needs for water, food, cleaning, and reconstruction supplies, as well as psychological support, during their visit to several affected areas on July 6[39].",
