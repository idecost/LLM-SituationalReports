    "summary": "Indonesia is currently experiencing multiple natural disasters, primarily severe flash floods and cold lava flows from Mount Marapi in West Sumatra, which began on May 11[8]. The death toll from these events has risen to 67, with 20 people still missing, and earlier reports indicated 57 victims found dead and 22 missing[3]. These disasters have affected at least six regencies and cities, including Agam and Tanah Datar, destroying hundreds of homes and damaging public infrastructure[17]. President Joko Widodo has directed authorities to accelerate the rebuilding of damaged infrastructure, while rescue operations involve thermal drones, excavators, and manual searching for survivors[2]. Weather modification technology is being deployed to reduce rainfall intensity, and a state of emergency is in effect until May 26[11]. Concurrently, Mount Ibu in North Maluku Province has seen a series of eruptions since April, with a significant eruption on May 27 spewing ash 6km high, prompting the evacuation of residents from seven nearby villages and over 12,000 people from a nearby island[24][2][4]. The volcano's alert level has been elevated to IV, and aviation warnings have been issued[2]. Additionally, earlier in May, flooding in Ogan Komering Ulu, South Sumatra, affected 1,695 families and displaced 257, causing substantial material losses[21].",

One such initiative involves training a team of residents in each village surrounding the volcano to assist with potential evacuations[9]. In parallel, the government is addressing the rebuilding of infrastructure in West Sumatra, with President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo urging authorities to expedite the reconstruction of damaged public infrastructure[10]. While most roads and temporary bridges have been rebuilt, some remain under construction[11]. Efforts to clear debris and repair infrastructure are ongoing, with heavy equipment being utilized to clean up disaster areas[11][12]. For example, on May 17, 2024, an excavator was employed to construct a temporary bridge over a river in Nagari Sungai Bambu, Tanah Datar regency, facilitating the delivery of aid to flood victims[10].\n\nIn addition to these efforts, the BNPB is employing weather modification technology, commonly known as cloud seeding, to manage rainfall intensity in disaster-struck areas[13]. This technology is used to aid rescue efforts by making clouds release rain earlier, thereby reducing the rainfall's intensity when it reaches the affected areas[13]. Specifically, the BNPB has been attempting to redirect rain away from rivers on the slopes of the volcano, in response to forecasts of moderate to heavy precipitation by the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG)[14][15]. This strategic use of cloud seeding aims to mitigate the impact of heavy rainfall on vulnerable regions[13].",

The death toll from the flash floods and cold lava flow in West Sumatra has tragically risen to 67 as of Thursday. The numbers have steadily increased from 43 deaths reported on May 11, to 44 by May 13, 50 by May 14, 52 by Tuesday, 57 by May 14, 58 by Wednesday, and 62 by Wednesday[20][21][22][23][24].\n\nApproximately 3,200 people have been temporarily displaced to safer areas, with more than 3,000 evacuated[25][24].

The DMRS, powered by PDC's DisasterAWARE technology, was launched in 2012 as a joint effort between PDC and the AHA Centre[27][28].

The DMRS empowers decision-makers by providing them with the necessary tools to understand risks and quickly mobilize life-saving humanitarian resources[27].\n\nMeanwhile, the agricultural sector faces challenges due to extreme weather conditions. Torrential rain and prolonged drought have severely impacted pepper farming, leading to dying plants, no harvest, and lower quality produce[29]. Earlier in the season, torrential rain destroyed the plants' flowers, and the subsequent drought caused more plants to die due to the lack of water[29]. Farmers reported extreme heat and no rain, resulting in no water for the pepper plants, with one farmer expecting no harvest this year compared to nine tonnes last year[29][30]. Another farmer noted that the little that could be harvested was of lower quality, predicting a scarcity of pepper for 2024 and 2025[31].
