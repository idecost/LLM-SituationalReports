    "summary": "Israeli military operations are escalating in Rafah, Gaza, with Israeli forces seizing the Rafah border crossing on Tuesday, which was a main entry point for aid, thereby dashing ceasefire hopes[27]. This seizure, along with the closure of the Kerem Shalom crossing, has halted the entry of fuel and aid into Gaza, creating a disastrous situation for humanitarian response and depleting critical supplies[30]. Israel has issued evacuation orders for parts of Rafah, causing chaos and panic among the population, with over 150,000 people having fled in recent days and around 300,000 affected by the orders[19]. Vulnerable individuals, including malnourished infants and injured patients, are among those forced to move to already overcrowded and unsafe areas like Al-Mawasi and Khan Younis, which lack adequate shelter and humanitarian supplies[19]. UN officials and humanitarian partners warn that these operations will lead to more death, displacement, and a humanitarian catastrophe, emphasizing that there are no safe spaces in Gaza[17]. Meanwhile, ceasefire talks are stalled, as Hamas accepted a proposal that Israel deemed unacceptable, particularly regarding a permanent end to hostilities[7], and violations against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have also substantially increased[12].",

            "retrieved_answer": "According to UN officials, the lack of fuel is critically impacting humanitarian operations and daily life in Gaza [1][2][4].\n\nFor humanitarian operations, fuel is considered critical and could run out \"tomorrow\" [1][4]. Andrea de Domenico, head of the UN humanitarian affairs office (OCHA), stated that humanitarians have approximately 30,000 litres of diesel available, while they normally use 200,000 litres daily [4]. The closure of the Rafah crossing with Egypt has cut off access to fuel, which affects the entry of critical relief items and restricts the movement of aid workers [1]. Scott Anderson from UNRWA noted that no fuel has entered the Gaza Strip, which is \"disastrous for the humanitarian response\" [2]. Aid agencies are nearly out of fuel [7], and stocks of critical supplies, including fuel, are being depleted hourly [8]. Priority for the remaining fuel is given to health, water, and communication, with some reserved for the secure movement of staff [4]. The UN aid coordination office (OCHA) is engaging with parties to resume the entry of goods, including fuel [8].\n\nRegarding daily life, UN humanitarians have reported concerns over dwindling supplies of fuel and other basic necessities in Gaza [2]. The prioritization of fuel for health, water, and communication services indicates the impact on these essential aspects of daily life [4].",

Hamas had agreed to a framework proposal that diverged from the one Israel had helped craft [4].\n\nAdditionally, Israel's renewed military activity in Rafah [1], its plan for an all-out assault on Rafah [3], and the seizure of the Rafah crossing by Israeli forces have dashed ceasefire hopes [11].
