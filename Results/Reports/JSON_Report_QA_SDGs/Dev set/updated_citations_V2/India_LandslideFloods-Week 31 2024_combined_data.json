  "summary": "India is grappling with severe natural calamities, primarily devastating landslides and heavy rainfall in Kerala's Wayanad district since the early hours of July 30th, alongside heavy rains impacting Delhi and the National Capital Region on August 1st[1]. In Wayanad, devastating landslides have resulted in at least 358 deaths and over 200 missing persons as of August 3rd, with earlier reports indicating 270 lives claimed and 378 missing by July 31st[2]. Thousands have been displaced, with over 11,000 individuals housed in 106 relief camps across Kerala[3]. The disaster has destroyed critical infrastructure, including a main bridge and hundreds of buildings, isolating many families and causing power outages[4]. Rescue operations are actively underway, involving the KSDMA, NDRF, army, police, and volunteers, utilizing helicopters, drones, and sniffer dogs, though efforts are challenged by continued heavy rains and blocked roads[5]. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued red alerts for extremely heavy rainfall in several Kerala districts, forecasting continued heavy showers[1]. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed distress and announced compensation for victims' families, while the Kerala government declared a state of mourning[6][7]. Experts attribute the increased frequency of such events to erratic monsoon patterns, climate change, and rapid, ecologically insensitive construction in the Western Ghats, emphasizing the urgent need for comprehensive action plans and improved early warning systems[8].",

Infrastructure was destroyed, with a bridge linking the affected forest area to the nearest town of Chooralmala being destroyed, necessitating the army to build a temporary or replacement crossing [49][50]. Locating victims was difficult as nearly 40 bodies were found 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the main landslide areas after being swept along the Chaliyar River [47][48]. People were also buried or swept away several miles downstream by torrents of mud, floodwater, and giant rolling boulders [48][51]. The catastrophic debris flows were extremely violent, making survival very difficult, especially since they struck before dawn when people were asleep in flimsy structures [52]. Additionally, large areas still needed to be explored and searched to find people [53].",

This ongoing bad weather is significantly hindering rescue operations [22], specifically preventing helicopters from participating in rescue efforts in Calicut [27].\n\nTo mitigate these impacts, several contingency plans and measures are in place:\n*   The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has deployed the Fireforce and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams [20]. Five NDRF teams are in the district, including two from Bengaluru and one from Kollam [27].\n*   Two Air Force helicopters are available to assist with rescue efforts [22], and Air Force aircraft are used for ferrying relief materials and personnel, having transported over 200 people [1]. The Indian Air Force is also supporting the transportation of essential supplies, including a Bailey Bridge [1].\n*   One Bailey Bridge and three search and rescue dogs have been airlifted from Delhi to Kannur to support searching for humans under landmass [28]. Police dogs and a drone team have also been deployed [27].\n*   A 24-hour control room operates under the State police chief for public information [27].\n*   A total of 118 relief camps have been established across Kerala, housing 5,531 inmates [24]. In Wayanad district alone, 45 relief camps house 3,069 people [26]. Relief camps were started at Meppadi School, Elavayal Anganwady, and St. Sebastian's Church Community Hall Chooralmala [20][29][19].\n*   Rescued individuals are shifted to the nearest relief camps [26]. Local self-government bodies are instructed to provide clean drinking water, food, and other facilities to those in camps and those isolated [26]. Local communities, volunteers, and organizations are also establishing relief camps and providing food and clothing [22].\n*   The Food and Civil Supplies Department is supplying food grains and essential supplies to relief camps [24]. People from tribal settlements have been provided with food, medicines, and other provisions [1].\n*   The Chief Minister has suggested humanitarian agencies coordinate with the district collector's office [24]. Five ministers are camping in Wayanad to coordinate rescue operations [26]. Four additional assistant collectors have been deployed to Wayanad [1].\n*   The General Education Department plans to dispatch teachers to camps so that children get access to education [1].\n*   The University of Calicut has postponed all exams scheduled until August 2 due to the rains [28].\n*   The Kerala government has declared a state of mourning on July 30 and 31 [26].",

Police dogs and a drone team have also been deployed [27].\n*   A 24-hour control room operates under the State police chief for public information [27].\n*   A total of 118 relief camps have been established across Kerala, housing 5,531 inmates [24].

Relief camps were started at Meppadi School, Elavayal Anganwady, and St. Sebastian's Church Community Hall Chooralmala [20][29][19].\n*   Rescued individuals are shifted to the nearest relief camps [26]. Local self-government bodies are instructed to provide clean drinking water, food, and other facilities to those in camps and those isolated [26]. Local communities, volunteers, and organizations are also establishing relief camps and providing food and clothing [22].\n*   The Food and Civil Supplies Department is supplying food grains and essential supplies to relief camps [24]. People from tribal settlements have been provided with food, medicines, and other provisions [1].\n*   The Chief Minister has suggested humanitarian agencies coordinate with the district collector's office [24].
