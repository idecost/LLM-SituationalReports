Urban flooding has been reported in various areas, with Lahore experiencing record rainfall that caused significant disruption, including electricity suspension, road closures, and submerged hospitals[2]. The floods have also damaged critical infrastructure such as bridges and roads, disrupting traffic in KP and Kashmir[1]. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued an \"ALERT\" for more torrential monsoon rains from August 1-6, warning of potential further flash flooding and landslides nationwide[3][4][5]. Simultaneously, the country is experiencing social unrest, including protests near the capital over escalating power bills and demonstrations in Balochistan concerning human rights, where hundreds have been detained and an internet shutdown imposed[6]. Additionally, a violent land dispute in Parachinar, Kurram, has resulted in significant casualties and a temporary ceasefire[7].",
