WHO and Health Cluster partners have difficulties reaching affected populations due to severe damage to transportation infrastructure, including roads and bridges. As a result, communities are isolated, and movement between villages is hindered by flowing rivers. In addition, the blockade of the Herat to Ghor road is hindering the delivery of emergency supplies from Herat, exacerbating the challenges faced by relief efforts.Poverty and a lack of community awareness regarding communicable diseases are significant obstacles to effective response and recovery efforts."]}, {"cluster_id": "-1", "question": " How is the Early Warning Information Working Group (EWIWG) addressing the forecasted below-average precipitation and above-average temperatures in Afghanistan, and what measures are being taken to mitigate potential impacts on agriculture and food security?", "retrieved_answer": "The Early Warning Information Working Group (EWIWG) addresses forecasted weather patterns by delivering comprehensive presentations on early warning information to cluster partners [5][6][7][8].
